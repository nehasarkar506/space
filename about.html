        In its over 30 years of operation, Hubble has made observations that have captured humanity’s imaginations and
        deepened our knowledge of the cosmos. It will continue to do so for years to come.

        <p class="text-center text-white my-5"> Hubble has peered back into our universe’s distant past, to locations
          more than 13.4 billion light-years from Earth, capturing galaxies merging, probing the supermassive black
          holes that lurk in their depths, and helping us better understand the history of the expanding universe.
          Hubble has made more than 1.5 million observations over the course of its lifetime. Over 19,000 peer-reviewed
          science papers have been published on its discoveries, and every current astronomy textbook includes
          contributions from the observatory. The telescope has tracked interstellar objects as they soared through our
          solar system, watched a comet collide with Jupiter, and discovered moons around Pluto. It has found dusty
          disks and stellar nurseries throughout the Milky Way that may one day become fully fledged planetary systems
          and studied the atmospheres of planets that orbit other stars.
