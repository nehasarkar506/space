        <p class="text-center">
          Since its 1990 launch, Hubble has changed our fundamental
          understanding of the universe. From its explorations of dark matter to
          its quest to determine the age of the universe, Hubble has helped
          answer some of the most compelling astronomical questions of our time,
          and revealed enigmas that we never knew existed.

        <p style="font-weight: 200">
          Since the dawn of civilization, humans have been limited in their
          understanding of the universe by their vision and imagination. The
          telescope enhanced our vision and tempered our pride, as observations
          by Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler in the 16th and 17th centuries
          rebuffed the millennia-old conceit that Earth is the center of the
          universe, spearheading the Scientific Revolution. By the 18th century,
          the telescope had become the indispensable instrument for
          investigating the cosmos. Bigger and better telescopes were being
          built all over the world. Planets, stars, and nebulae that could not
          be seen by the naked eye were being routinely noted and logged.
          Advances in photography, spectroscopy (splitting light into its
          component colors), and photometry (measuring the brightnesses of
          celestial objects) increased telescope versatility, sensitivity, and
          discovery power.

            <h2>The Telescope</h2>
            <p class="pb-4">
              By the turn of the 20th century, most astronomers believed that
              the observable universe consisted of one galaxy, our Milky Way, an
              oasis of stars, dust, and gas in the vastness of space. However,
              in 1924, American astronomer Edwin Hubble used the 100-inch Hooker
              Telescope on Mount Wilson near Los Angeles, California, to study
              many other galaxies besides our own Milky Way, finding almost all
              of them moving away from each other. This suggested that the
              universe is expanding, unleashing a Pandora's box of seminal
              inquiries about the possible beginning and end of the universe —
              issues that are still being debated to this day. Astronomers both
              before and after Edwin Hubble have toiled over long, frigid nights
              inside enormous dome-shaped observatories, pointing their
              telescopes skyward, yearning for the best possible glimpse of the
              heavens. However, they faced a major obstacle that stood between
              them and a clear view of the universe: Earth's atmosphere. The
              atmosphere is a fluid, chaotic soup of gas and dust. It blurs
              visible light, causing stars to twinkle and making it difficult to
              see faint stars. It hinders or even totally absorbs other
              wavelengths of light, making observations of such wavelength
              ranges as infrared, ultraviolet, gamma rays, and X-rays difficult
              or virtually impossible. (It is also these properties that protect
              us from the harmful effects of these rays.) Observatories with the
              largest of telescopes in various continents have been perched upon
              mountain tops and away from distracting city lights, with varying
              levels of success. Adaptive optics (using deformable mirrors to
              refocus blurred light from the cosmos) and other image-processing
              techniques have minimized — but not totally eliminated — the
              effects of the atmosphere.

            <h2>A Telescope in Space?</h2>
            <p class="pb-4">
              In 1923, German scientist Hermann Oberth, one of the three fathers
              of modern rocketry (along with Robert Goddard and Konstantin
              Tsiolkovsky), published "Die Rakete zu den Planetenraumen" ("The
              Rocket into Planetary Space"), which mentioned how a telescope
              could be propelled into Earth orbit by a rocket. In 1946,
              Princeton astrophysicist Lyman Spitzer wrote about the scientific
              benefits of a telescope in space, above Earth's turbulent
              atmosphere. Following the launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik
              in 1957, the fledgling National Aeronautics and Space
              Administration (NASA) successfully launched two Orbital
              Astronomical Observatories (OAOs) into orbit. They made a number
              of ultraviolet observations and provided learning experiences for
              the manufacture and launch of future space observatories.

            <h2>The Large Space Telescope</h2>
            <p class="pb-4">
              Meanwhile, scientific, governmental, and industrial groups planned
              the next step beyond the OAO program. Spitzer gathered the support
              of other astronomers for a "large orbital telescope" and addressed
              the concerns of its critics. In 1969, the National Academy of
              Sciences gave its approval for the Large Space Telescope (LST)
              project, and the hearings and feasibility studies continued. After
              Armstrong's "giant leap for mankind" on the Moon in 1969, funding
              for NASA space programs began to dwindle, putting the LST program
              in jeopardy. LST planners had to design the telescope under budget
              constraints. A number of downsizing measures were considered, such
              as decreasing the size of the primary mirror, the number of
              scientific instruments, or the number of spare parts created and
              tests performed. Ultimately, the size of the main mirror was
              reduced from 120 inches to 94. In 1974, the LST Science Working
              Group recommended the space telescope carry a large complement of
              interchangeable instruments. The requirements for these
              instruments were to resolve at least one-tenth of an arcsecond (or
              1/36,000 of a degree of arc across the sky), and have a wavelength
              range from ultraviolet through visible to infrared light.

            <h2>The Space Shuttle</h2>
            <p class="pb-4">
              NASA and its industrial partners — called contractors — brought up
              the option of developing a vehicle that could achieve orbit,
              return to Earth intact, and be reused repeatedly; the concept of
              the space shuttle was born. The space shuttle could deploy the LST
              into space and reel it back for return to Earth. In turn, the
              telescope’s designers created the telescope to fit snugly inside
              the shuttle’s cargo bay. NASA suggested that the lifetime of the
              space telescope be 15 years, which implied that the instruments
              needed to be replaced periodically on the ground or even serviced
              in orbit — an ability not afforded to any satellite before or
              since. Scientists also had to balance the size and quantity of
              scientific instruments versus their cost. Too many instruments
              meant financial support was less likely; conversely, instruments
              of minimal capability would result in the loss of scientific
              support for the telescope. The European Space Agency (ESA) joined
              the project in 1975 and provided fifteen percent of the funding of
              the LST via contribution of the Faint Object Camera (FOC) and the
              solar arrays. In return, NASA guaranteed at least fifteen percent
              of telescope time — the amount of time astronomers use the
              telescope for space observations — to European astronomers. In
              1977, Congress approved funding to build one of the most
              sophisticated satellites ever constructed.

            <h2>Who Does What?</h2>
            <p class="pb-4">
              NASA chose Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, as
              the lead NASA field center for the design, development, and
              construction of the space telescope. Marshall delegated
              Perkin-Elmer Corporation (now Hughes Danbury Optical Systems) the
              task of developing the Optical Telescope Assembly and the Fine
              Guidance Sensors. Lockheed Missiles and Space Company (now
              Lockheed Martin) was selected by Marshall to build the
              spacecraft’s outer structure and the Support Systems Module (the
              internal support systems, which include the computer, power,
              communications, pointing and control systems), and then assemble
              the telescope together. NASA chose Goddard Space Flight Center in
              Greenbelt, Maryland, to be the lead in scientific instrument
              design and ground control for the space observatory. Scientists
              were organized into "Instrument Definition Teams," which would
              translate scientific aims into scientific devices and incorporate
              them into the space telescope housing. After an announcement was
              made to the astronomy community, proposals were received and
              judged, and five devices were selected as the initial instruments
              that would be aboard the space telescope: the Faint Object Camera,
              the Wide Field/Planetary Camera, the Faint Object Spectrograph,
              the High Resolution Spectrograph, and the High Speed Photometer.
              The Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and the Kennedy Space
              Center in Florida supplied space shuttle support. In all, dozens
              of contractors, a handful of universities, and several NASA
              centers, spanning 21 states and 12 other countries worldwide, made
              the dream of a telescope above the clouds and in space a reality.
              In 1983, the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) was
              established at The Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,
              Maryland. The staff of STScI would evaluate proposals for
              telescope time and manage the resulting telescope observations. A
              number of delays stemming from underestimating the costs and
              engineering requirements of the state-of-the-art telescope caused
              the launch date to be moved from December 1983 to the second half
              of 1986. NASA re-examined interfaces, instruments, and assemblies.
              The building of the Optical Telescope Assembly encountered
              engineering challenges. Scientific instruments, such as the Wide
              Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC), underwent redesign, removing
              weight and redundancy.

            <h2>Hubble Is Born</h2>
            <p class="pb-4">
              To maintain and upgrade the space telescope, plans were made to
              conduct servicing missions in orbit versus returning the telescope
              to Earth and refurbishing it on the ground. It was an innovative
              concept that would be even easier on a budget. In the midst of
              this spirit of renovation, the space telescope was renamed the
              Hubble Space Telescope (HST). By 1985, the telescope was assembled
              and ready for launch. However, in 1986 disaster struck. The
              Challenger accident forced NASA to ground the space shuttle fleet
              for two years. The HST Project used that time to perform further
              work on the telescope. Solar panels were improved with new solar
              cell technology. The aft shroud (the end of the telescope that
              houses the science instruments) was modified to make instrument
              replacement during servicing easier. Computers and communication
              systems were upgraded. The space telescope was subjected to
              further stress tests to prepare for the harsh conditions of
              liftoff and space. Finally, on April 24, 1990, the space shuttle
              Discovery lifted off from Earth with the Hubble Space Telescope
              nestled securely in its bay. The following day, Hubble was
              released into orbit, ready to peer into the vast unknown of space,
              offering a glimpse at distant, exotic cosmic shores yet to be
              described.

            <h2>Hubble’s Mirror Flaw</h2>
            <p class="pb-4">
              When Hubble began returning science data to Earth, astronomers did
              not see crisp, point-like images of stars. Instead, they saw stars
              surrounded by large, fuzzy halos of light. They soon realized that
              this issue was created because the edges of the telescope’s
              primary mirror were ground too flat by just a fraction of the
              width of a human hair. Although perfectly smooth, the mirror could
              not focus light to a single point. It had been ground to the wrong
              shape because of a flaw introduced into the test equipment used to
              evaluate the mirror’s curvature prior to launch. Although
              engineers designed Hubble with many replaceable components, the
              primary mirror was not one of them. However, the ability for
              astronauts to upgrade the observatory in orbit ultimately led to a
              solution for this seemingly unconquerable problem. Before NASA
              even launched Hubble, engineers were hard at work building an
              improved, second-generation camera for the space telescope. This
              instrument, called the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2),
              was meant for installation by astronauts at a future date. Optics
              experts realized they could build corrective optics into this
              camera to counteract the flaw in the primary mirror. Meanwhile,
              Hubble scientists and engineers devised a set of nickel- and
              quarter-sized mirrors to remedy the effects of the primary mirror
              on Hubble’s other instruments. Labeled the Corrective Optics Space
              Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR), this refrigerator-sized
              device could deploy the corrective mirrors into the light paths of
              the telescope’s other science instruments to focus their images
              properly.

            <h2>Servicing Missions</h2>
            <p>
              Hubble was designed to be serviced periodically by astronauts in
              space, and was therefore built with modular components that are
              astronaut-friendly to handle and replace. This allowed the
              telescope to be equipped with new, state-of-the-art science
              instruments and other equipment during five servicing missions
              from 1993 to 2009. In December 1993 the first servicing mission
              (SM1) launched. New instruments were installed such as the WFPC2
              and COSTAR, which countered the effects of the primary mirror’s
              flawed shape. In February 1997 the second servicing mission (SM2)
              took place, resulting in the replacement of degrading spacecraft
              components, and the installation of new instruments such as the
              Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared
              Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS). STIS separated the
              light the telescope took in, and “dissected” it so that the
              composition, temperature, motion, and other properties could be
              analyzed. With NICMOS astronomers could see the first clear views
              of the universe at near-infrared wavelengths. On November 13,
              1999, the fourth of six gyroscopes (gyros) failed on Hubble, and
              the telescope temporarily closed its eyes on the universe.

              Gyros measure the spacecraft’s rate of motion and help point
              Hubble toward its observation target. Unable to conduct science
              without three working gyros, Hubble entered a state of dormancy
              called safe mode. Essentially, Hubble “went to sleep” while it
              waited for help. Hubble’s third servicing mission was originally
              conceived as one of maintenance, but when the fourth gyro failed
              NASA split the mission into two parts: Servicing Mission 3A (SM3A)
              flew in December 1999 and Servicing Mission 3B (SM3B) in March
              2002. SM3A astronauts replaced all six gyroscopes with new ones,
              and installed a faster, more powerful main computer, a
              next-generation solid-state data recorder, a new transmitter, new
              insulation, and other equipment. During SM3B, astronauts installed
              a new science instrument called the Advanced Camera for Surveys
              (ACS). ACS sees in wavelengths ranging from visible to
              far-ultraviolet, and can produce 10 times the science results in
              the same amount of time than the camera it replaced, the Faint
              Object Camera (FOC). Servicing Mission 4 (SM4), the fifth visit to
              Hubble, occurred in May 2009. Astronauts installed two new
              scientific instruments: the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) and
              Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3). Two failed instruments, the Space
              Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Advanced Camera for
              Surveys (ACS), were brought back to life by the first-ever
              on-orbit instrument repairs. In order to prolong Hubble’s life,
              other components were replaced including new batteries, new
              gyroscopes, and a new science computer. In addition, a device was
              attached to the base of the telescope to facilitate de-orbiting
              when the telescope is eventually decommissioned. Each of the
              servicing missions has been crucial to Hubble’s success and
              longevity. The servicing missions have enhanced the telescope’s
              science capabilities, leading to fascinating new discoveries about
              the universe.

            <h2>Hubble Today</h2>
            <p class="pb-4">
              Hubble’s mission was to spend at least 15 years probing the
              farthest and faintest reaches of the cosmos. Hubble has far
              exceeded this goal, operating and observing the universe for over
              30 years. During its time in orbit, the telescope has taken more
              than 1.5 million observations, and astronomers have used that data
              to publish more than 19,000 peer-reviewed scientific publications
              on a broad range of topics. With any piece of machinery that’s 30
              years old comes some aging parts. No more servicing missions are
              scheduled to repair or replace equipment on Hubble. However, a
              dedicated team of engineers and scientists are continuously
              working to keep Hubble operating for as long as possible. For
              example, Hubble’s engineers have figured out a way the telescope
              could continue observing the universe on only one gyro, using
              other types of sensors on the spacecraft to make up for gyros that
              have failed. This and other innovations designed to extend the
              lifetime of Hubble’s equipment will keep the telescope exploring
              for years to come. While nearly impossible to provide a
              comprehensive list of all the scientific contributions Hubble has
              made so far during its career, the telescope’s observations have
              contributed to the understanding of the development and growth of
              galaxies, the presence of black holes in most galaxies, the birth
              of stars, and the atmospheric composition of planets outside our
              solar system. Hubble’s explorations have fundamentally changed our
              perception of the universe and will continue to reveal new
              insights for many more years.
