          Do you know how much data Hubble sends to Earth? Can you guess the
          size of its mirror? Get the facts and figures behind the Hubble Space
          Telescope. The Hubble Space Telescope explores the universe from Earth
          orbit. This vantage point allows it to obtain a view of cosmic objects
          unobstructed by Earth's atmosphere, which can distort light and block
          certain wavelengths. NASA named Hubble after American astronomer Edwin
          P. Hubble (1889–1953). Hubble confirmed an "expanding" universe, which
          provided the foundation for the Big Bang theory.

            <h2>Where is the Hubble Space Telescope?</h2>
            <p class="pb-4">
              The Hubble Space Telescope orbits just above Earth’s atmosphere at
              an altitude of approximately 332 miles (535 km). Hubble orbits at
              a speed of 17,000 miles per hour (27,000 kph) and completes one
              orbit approximately every 95 minutes. Hubble gets clear images
              because it’s above Earth’s atmosphere, not because it travels or
              flies closer to cosmic objects. Hubble isn’t that far away, but
              its location above the murky atmosphere allows the telescope to
              get a clear view of the universe. Earth’s atmosphere distorts and
              blurs light, and absorbs certain wavelengths of the
              electromagnetic spectrum. The atmosphere helps protect us from
              harmful radiation, but also makes it difficult for ground-based
              telescopes to get sharp images of cosmic objects.

            <p class="pb-4">
              When Hubble launched in 1990, it was expected to have a lifespan
              of about 15 years. Largely because of five successful astronaut
              servicing missions to the telescope, Hubble’s technology was
              upgraded and improved, and the telescope remains scientifically
              productive to this day. All indications are that the telescope
              will continue operating into the late 2020s and possibly beyond.

            <h2>Is the James Webb Space Telescope replacing Hubble?</h2>
            <p class="pb-4">
              A common misconception is that the James Webb Space Telescope
              would “replace” Hubble. However, Webb has different capabilities
              than Hubble (see: Hubble vs. Webb), and the goal is for both
              telescopes to operate at the same time to conduct joint
              observations for several years. In some ways, Webb will be
              Hubble’s successor; for instance, Webb is designed to make
              observations solely in infrared wavelengths, meaning it will see
              farther into the universe, both “back in time” and through clouds
              of dust, to learn about stellar and galactic evolution, planet
              formation, and more. Webb launched into orbit on Dec. 25, 2021.

            <h2>How was Hubble repaired and upgraded while in space?</h2>
            <p class="pb-4">
              NASA’s space shuttle program made it possible for Hubble to be
              deployed and revisited several times in space by astronauts. Once
              in orbit around Earth, the space shuttle matched the speed of
              Hubble’s orbit to rendezvous with the telescope. Hubble was
              captured by the space shuttle’s robotic arm, and clamped into the
              cargo bay while astronauts completed extravehicular activities or
              “spacewalks” to manually make repairs and installations. Then, the
              shuttle would release the telescope back into orbit.

                missions planned for Hubble?</b
              ><br />
              No. With the retirement of the space shuttle, there is currently
              no capability to service Hubble.

              What will happen to Hubble when the telescope is no longer
              operational? Will it return to Earth?
            </h2>
            <p class="pb-4">
              Hubble is not expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere until the
              mid to late 2030s at the earliest. Due to a force called
              atmospheric drag, which affects the orbits of satellites like
              Hubble in low-Earth orbit, Hubble’s altitude is slowly decreasing.
              A propulsion module will eventually be attached to the telescope
              to complete either a controlled reentry into the south Pacific
              ocean, or to boost Hubble into a much higher orbit to keep the
              inoperative telescope aloft for several more decades.

            <h2>Who decides what Hubble looks at?</h2>
            <p class="pb-4">
              The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) is located in
              Baltimore, Maryland and oversees Hubble’s science operations.
              STScI manages the selection process of proposals to use Hubble,
              schedules the resulting observations, processes the data, and so
              forth. Time with Hubble is a scarce resource and highly
              competitive. Approximately 150 scientists from around the world
              evaluate and rank proposals as part of the Time Allocation
              Committee. The proposals are evaluated based on their scientific
              merit, and the committee’s recommended selection is then forwarded
              to the STScI director for final approval. Ten percent of Hubble’s
              observation time is also set aside for discretionary purposes as
              decided by the director. Observations such as the Hubble deep
              fields and the Hubble Frontier Fields have come from the
              director’s discretionary time.

            <h2>How does Hubble move and rotate?</h2>
            <p class="pb-4">
              To change pointing direction, Hubble uses Newton’s third law,
              which states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
              Hubble spins four internal wheels weighing about 100 lbs (45 kg).
              When spun in a clockwise direction, the spacecraft itself will
              turn counterclockwise. All four wheels are oriented at a different
              angle so that Hubble can be spun around all three of its axes. The
              spacecraft turns at about the speed of a minute hand on a clock,
              taking about 15 minutes to turn 90 degrees. Hubble also has four
              Magnetic Torquer Bars. These are eight-foot-long magnets that can
              be turned on or off. Like a compass needle that gets pulled toward
              the north pole, they use the Earth’s magnetic field to pull or
              push Hubble along its axes in the desired direction.

              Hubble’s instruments are made to see faint objects, so the bright

              below Hubble, making it difficult to stay on a particular

              The Hubble Space Telescope is equipped with cameras that take
              images over a broad range of wavelengths. Hubble’s images are
              recorded in grayscale, but scientists can create a composite color
              image by taking exposures using different color filters on the
              telescope, assigning a color to each filter that corresponds to
              the wavelength of that filter, and combining the images.
              Sometimes, parts of images are assigned colors to visually show
              what isn’t visible to the human eye (for example, infrared
              wavelengths that your eye cannot detect), or to highlight the
              presence of certain elements.

              A previous camera installed on Hubble, called the Wide Field and
              Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2), produced a “step” effect on many
              images. The dark regions or “missing” parts of those images are
              simply portions that have no Hubble data. Three of the camera’s
              four light detectors imaged “wide fields,” while the fourth
              detector (PC for planetary camera) had higher resolution but
              covered a smaller portion of the sky. With all four combined, the
              “step” effect resulted, meaning there are areas where Hubble
              observations were not taken. WFPC2 was replaced during Hubble’s
              last servicing mission in 2009.

              objects (like galaxies or nebulae) that are named “M” or “NGC”
