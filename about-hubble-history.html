                First conceived in the 1940s and initially called the Large Space Telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope
                took decades of planning and research before it launched on April 24, 1990. Since launch, Hubble has
                overcome its troubled beginnings to perform innumerable science observations that have revolutionized
                humanity’s understanding of the universe. From determining the age of the universe to observing dramatic
                changes on celestial bodies in our own solar system, Hubble has become one of humanity’s greatest
                scientific instruments.



                This timeline describes Hubble’s history from the first proposal of a space telescope by Lyman Spitzer
                in 1946, through the completion of Hubble’s five servicing missions in the 1990s and 2000s, and to many
                of the significant observations and discoveries Hubble has made during its years in orbit.

                    <h2>HUBBLE DEPLOYED</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">In this April 25, 1990, photograph taken by the crew of the STS-31 space shuttle
                        mission, the Hubble Space Telescope is suspended above shuttle Discovery's cargo bay some 332
                        nautical miles above Earth. The Canadian-built Remote Manipulator System (RMS) arm, controlled
                        from in-cabin by the astronaut crew members, held the huge telescope in this position during
                        pre-deployment procedures, which included extension of solar array panels and antennae.

                        STS-31 was the tenth launch of the shuttle Discovery. On board were Commander Loren J. Shriver,
                        Pilot Charles F. Bolden, Jr. (NASA Administrator 2009-2017), Mission Specialists Steven A.
                        Hawley, Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn D. Sullivan (NOAA Administrator 2014-2017). To launch
                        Hubble into an orbit that guaranteed longevity, Discovery soared to a record altitude of 600 km.

                    <h2>FIRST IMAGE TAKEN</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        The “first light” image from Hubble was taken with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera to assist
                        in focusing the telescope. The image illustrated Hubble’s improved resolution compared to
                        ground-based observatories, showing that its images were roughly 50 percent sharper than
                        ground-based images.
                        This "first light" image from Hubble was released in May 1990, to illustrate the telescope's
                        improved resolution when compared to ground-based observatories. On the right is part of the
                        first image taken with the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field/Planetary Camera. It is shown
                        with a ground-based picture of the same region of the sky from Las Campanas Observatory in
                        Chile. The Las Campanas picture was taken with a 100-inch telescope and it is typical of
                        high-quality pictures obtained from the ground.
                        The images of the stars in the ground-based picture are fuzzy, and in some cases overlap,
                        because of the smearing effect of Earth's atmosphere. The same stars in the Hubble frame are
                        sharper, as shown by the double star at the top of the image. In this early engineering picture,
                        the Hubble images are roughly 50 percent sharper than the ground-based images.

                        The first image taken with Hubble was intended to assist in focusing the telescope. The region
                        observed is centered on the 8.2-magnitude star HD96755 in the open cluster NGC 3532, in the
                        southern constellation Carina. Identical small subsections of the Hubble and ground-based images
                        were chosen to highlight the difference in resolution. The field shown is approximately 11-by-14
                        arcseconds in size and does not contain HD96755.

                    <p class="pb-4">
                        The Soviet Union successfully launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1. Sputnik was
                        about the size of a beach ball, weighed only 193 pounds and took about 98 minutes to orbit Earth
                        once. The launch of Sputnik caused the start of the space race between the United States and
                        Soviet Union. The United States soon followed with the launch of its first satellite, Explorer
                        1, on January 31, 1958.
                        On Oct. 4, 1957, Sputnik 1 successfully launched and entered Earth's orbit. Thus, began the
                        space age. The successful launch shocked the world, giving the former Soviet Union the
                        distinction of putting the first human-made object into space. The word 'Sputnik' originally
                        meant 'fellow traveler,' but has become synonymous with 'satellite' in modern Russian.

                        This historic image shows a technician putting the finishing touches on Sputnik 1, humanity's
                        first artificial satellite. The pressurized sphere made of aluminum alloy had five primary
                        scientific objectives: Test the method of placing an artificial satellite into Earth orbit;
                        provide information on the density of the atmosphere by calculating its lifetime in orbit; test
                        radio and optical methods of orbital tracking; determine the effects of radio wave propagation
                        though the atmosphere; and, check principles of pressurization used on the satellites.

                    <h2>NASA CREATED</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        After the launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union in 1957, Congress passed the Space Act in July
                        1958. The Space Act created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), effective
                        on October 1, 1958, from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) and other
                        government agencies.
                        It may well be argued that NASA has become the world's premier agent for exploration, carrying
                        on in "the new ocean" of outer space a long tradition of expanding the physical and mental
                        boundaries of humanity. Fifty years ago, however the agency that pushed the frontiers of
                        aeronautics, took us to the moon, flew the space shuttle, built the International Space Station
                        and revealed the secrets of the cosmos, was in its birth throes, and fundamental decisions were
                        being made that profoundly shaped all that was to come.
                        The driving force, of course, was the launch of Sputnik on Oct. 4, 1957, followed by its even
                        weightier successors. In the midst of the Cold War, a country that aspired to global preeminence
                        could not let that challenge pass. Although the United States already had its own satellite
                        plans in place as part of the International Geophysical Year, the Russian events spurred the
                        Space Age, and in particular gave urgency to the founding of an American national space agency.
