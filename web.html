                      <p>
                        Form its orbit around Earth,Hubble has revealed a
                        previously
                        hidden universe.
                        Planets being born in knots of dust. An unknown energy
                        propelling the expansion of the universe. Shattered
                        comets and
                        misshapen asteroids. Galaxies that crash together to
                        remake
                        themselves. Faint, distant glimpses of light from the
                        universe’s
                        most distant collections of stars.

                        For more than 25 years, the Hubble Space Telescope has
                        brought
                        the wonder, beauty and mysteries of the universe to
                        Earth,
                        spinning pictures out of light that have transformed our
                        understanding of the universe.

                        With over 1.5 million observations and counting, Hubble
                        continues to trek above Earth’s surface, free of the
                        light-distorting and blocking effects of our planet’s
                        atmosphere, beaming home data that reveals the answers
                        to some
                        of our most critical questions about the cosmos.

                      <h3>Highlights</h3>
                      <p>Learn about some of Hubble's most exciting scientific
                        discoveries.
                        Almost four centuries later, the launch of NASA’s Hubble
                        Space
                        Telescope aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery in 1990
                        started
                        another revolution in astronomy.
                        Developed as a partnership between the United States
                        space
                        program and the European Space Agency, Hubble orbits 332
                        miles
                        (535 km) above Earth’s surface.
                        Its gaze outward lies beyond the distorting effects of
                        the
                        atmosphere, which blurs starlight and blocks some
                        important
                        wavelengths of light from reaching the ground.
                        This vantage point allows Hubble to observe astronomical
                        objects
                        and phenomena more consistently and with better detail
                        than
                        generally attainable from ground-based
                        observatories. The telescope's sensitive cameras and
                        spectrographs can view objects as nearby and small as
                        colliding
                        asteroids to distant star-forming galaxies
                        that date back to when the universe was only three
                        percent of
                        its current age.

                      <h3> Hubble's Deep Fields</h3>
                      <p>Look back in space and time through billons of years of
                        galaxy
                        evolution.
                        The Hubble Space Telescope has made over 1.5 million
                        observations since its launch in 1990, capturing
                        stunning
                        subjects such as the Eagle Nebula and producing data
                        that has
                        been featured in almost 18,000 scientific articles. But
                        no image
                        has revolutionized the way we understand the universe as
                        much as
                        the Hubble Deep Field.

                        Taken over the course of 10 days in 1995, the Hubble
                        Deep Field
                        captured roughly 3,000 distant galaxies varying in their
                        stages
                        of evolution.
                        History played out a little differently. In 1994, Robert
                        Williams, director of the Space Telescope Science
                        Institute in
                        Baltimore, Maryland, developed an interest in
                        Hubble’s ability to observe distant objects when he
                        witnessed
                        exposures taken in May and June by Wide Field and
                        Planetary
                        Camera.

        <p class="mt-5 text-center ">On April 24, 1990, the space shuttle
          Discovery lifted off from Earth with the Hubble
          Space Telescope nestled
          securely in its payload bay. The following day, Hubble was released
          into space, ready to peer into the vast
          unknown. Since then, Hubble has reinvigorated and reshaped our
          perception of the cosmos and uncovered a universe
          of unexpected wonders. Hubble has revealed properties of space and
          time that for most of human history were only
          probed in the imaginations of scientists and philosophers. Today,
          Hubble continues to provide views of cosmic
          wonders never before seen and is at the forefront of many new
          discoveries.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Since the dawn of
                          civilization, humans have been limited in their
                          understanding of the universe by their vision
                          and imagination.

                          By the 18th century, the telescope had become
                          the indispensable instrument for investigating
                          the cosmos. Bigger and better telescopes were
                          being built
                          all over the world. Planets, stars, and nebulae
                          that could not be seen by the naked eye were
                          being routinely noted and logged. Advances in
                          photography,
                          spectroscopy (splitting light into its component
                          colors), and photometry (measuring the
                          brightnesses of celestial objects) increased
                          telescope
                          versatility, sensitivity, and discovery power.

                          called the Large Space Telescope, the Hubble
                          Space Telescope took decades
                          of planning and research before it launched on
                          April 24, 1990. Since launch, Hubble has
                          overcome its troubled beginnings to perform
                          innumerable science observations that have
                          revolutionized humanity’s understanding of the
                          universe. From determining the age of the
                          universe
                          to observing dramatic changes on celestial
                          bodies in our own solar system, Hubble has
                          become one of humanity’s greatest scientific
                          instruments.

                          The Hubble Space Telescope explores the universe
                          from Earth orbit. This vantage point allows it
                          to obtain a view of cosmic objects unobstructed
                          by Earth's atmosphere, which can distort light
                          and block certain wavelengths.NASA named Hubble
                          after American astronomer Edwin P.
                          Hubble (1889–1953). Hubble confirmed an
                          "expanding" universe, which provided the
                          foundation for the Big Bang theory.
                          Hubble isn’t that far away, but its location
                          above the murky atmosphere allows the telescope
                          to get a clear view of the universe.

                          Shortly after the Hubble Space Telescope was
                          deployed in 1990, the observatory's primary
                          mirror was discovered to have an aberration
                          that affected the clarity of the telescope's
                          early images. Fortunately, Hubble was the first
                          telescope designed to be visited in
                          space by astronauts to perform repairs, replace
                          parts and update its technology with new
                          instruments. Astronauts first visited Hubble
                          in orbit in December 1993.

                          what they wanted or slowly
                          discovered their calling. One developed a
                          lifetime goal of working at NASA at just 9 years
                          old after a neighbor gave him a tour.
                          Another found herself questioning her career
                          path when she suffered multiple job losses right

                          When you look up at the sky at night and see the
                          stars twinkling,
                          you’re really seeing shifting pockets of air
                          creating an effect called atmospheric
                          distortion. It’s pretty, but it prevents
                          earthbound
                          telescopes from getting the kind of
                          crystal-clear view that Hubble can achieve.
                          Hubble’s low-Earth orbit also kept it within a
                          safe
                          and accessible range for astronauts, who used
                          the space shuttle to visit the telescope

        <h2 class="text-center mt-5 ">Observatory</h2>
        <p class="text-center mt-5">The Hubble Space Telescope was the first
          astronomical observatory to be placed into
          orbit around Earth with the
          ability to record images in wavelengths of light spanning from
          ultraviolet to near-infrared. Launched on April
          24, 1990, aboard the space shuttle Discovery, Hubble is located about
          340 miles (547 km) above Earth’s surface,
          where it completes 15 orbits per day — approximately one every 95
          minutes. The satellite moves at the speed of
          about five miles (8 km) per second, fast enough to travel across the
          United States in about 10 minutes. </p>

              <p>Hubble’s science instruments, the astronomer’s eyes to the
                universe, work together or individually
                to provide the observations. Each instrument is designed to
                examine the universe in a different way.
                Hubble holds two main varieties of instruments: cameras, which
                capture Hubble's famed images, and
                spectrographs, which break light into colors for analysis.</p>

              <p>Hubble uses two mirrors, laid out in a Cassegrain telescope
                design, to collect and focus light.
                After light travels down the length of the telescope, it hits
                the concave, or bowl-shaped, primary
                mirror.</p>
