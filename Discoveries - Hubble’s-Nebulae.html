                Hubble's variable nebula is named (like the Hubble telescope itself) after the American astronomer Edwin
                P. Hubble, who carried out some ofthe early studies of this object. It is a fan-shaped cloud of gas and
                dust which is illuminated by R Monocerotis (R Mon), the bright star at the bottom end of the nebula.
                Dense condensations of dust near the star cast shadows out into the nebula, and as they move the
                illumination changes, giving rise to the variations first noted by Hubble. The star itself, lying about
                2,500 light-years from Earth, cannot be seen directly, but only through light scattered off of dust
                particles in the surrounding nebula. R Mon is believed to have a mass of about 10 times that of the Sun,
                and to have an age of only 300,000 years. There is probably a symmetrical counterpart of the fan-shaped
                nebula on the southern side of the star, but it is heavily obscured from view by dust lying between this
                lobe and our line of sight.
                Several types of nebulae exist, and each individual nebula is a unique showcase of the phenomena and
                processes happening within. They often live side by side, with smaller nebulae populating larger clouds
                of gas and dust to form giant complexes of star birth and death.

                    <h2>Emission Nebulae</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        Emission nebulae are so named because they emit their own light. This type of nebula forms when
                        the intense radiation of stars within or near the nebula energizes the gas. A star’s ultraviolet
                        radiation floods the gas with so much energy that it strips electrons from the nebula’s hydrogen
                        atoms, a process called ionization. As the energized electrons revert from their higher-energy
                        state to a lower-energy state by recombining with atoms, they emit energy in the form of light,
                        causing the nebula’s gas to glow.

                        A famous example of an emission nebula is the Orion Nebula, a huge, star-forming nebula in the
                        constellation Orion. The Orion Nebula is home to a star cluster defined by four massive stars
                        known as the Trapezium. These stars are only a few hundred thousand years old, about 15-30 times
                        the mass of the Sun, and so hot and bright that they’re responsible for illuminating the entire
                        Orion nebula. But thousands of additional, mostly young stars are embedded in the nebula. The
                        most massive are 50 to 100 times the mass of our Sun.

                        The radiation and solar winds of stars within emission nebulae carve and sculpt the nebula’s
                        gas, creating caverns and pillars but also creating pressures on the gas clouds that can give
                        rise to more starbirth.

                    <h2>Reflection Nebulae</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        Reflection nebulae reflect the light from nearby stars. The stars that illuminate them aren’t
                        powerful enough to ionize the nebula’s gas, as with emission nebulae, but their light scatters
                        through the gas and dust causing it to glow ― like a flashlight beam shining on mist in the
                        dark.

                        Because of the way light scatters when it hits the fine dust of the interstellar medium, these
                        reflection nebulae are often bluish in color.

                        A reflection nebula called NGC 1999 lies close to the famous Orion Nebula, about 1,500
                        light-years from Earth. The nebula is illuminated by a bright, recently formed star called V380
                        Orionis, and the gas and dust of the nebula is material left over from that star’s formation. A
                        second well-known reflection nebula is illuminated by the Pleiades star cluster. Most nebulae
                        around star clusters consist of material that the stars formed from. But the Pleiades shines on
                        an independent cloud of gas and dust, drifting through the cluster at about 6.8 miles/second (11
                        km/s).

                    <h2>Planetary Nebulae</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        When astronomers looked at the sky through early telescopes, they found many indistinct, cloudy
                        forms. They called such objects “nebulae,” Latin for clouds. Some of the fuzzy objects resembled
                        planets, and these earned the name “planetary nebulae.”

                        Today these nebulae keep the name, but we know they have nothing to do with planets. Planetary
                        nebulae form during the death of low-mass to medium-mass stars. When such stars die, they expel
                        their outer layers into space. These expanding shells of gas form a huge variety of unique
                        shapes ― rings, hourglasses, rectangles, and more ― that show the complexity of stellar death.
                        Astronomers are still studying how these intricate shapes form at the end of a star’s life.

                        As the star casts off its outer layers, it leaves behind its core, which becomes a white dwarf
                        star. White dwarf stars are objects with the approximate mass of the Sun but the size of Earth,
                        making them one of the densest forms of matter in the universe after black holes and neutron
                        stars. The white dwarf star’s ultraviolet radiation ionizes the gas of the planetary nebula and
                        causes it to glow, just as stars do in emission nebulae. Our Sun is expected to form a planetary
                        nebula at the end of its life.

                    <h2>Supernova Remnants</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        Not all stars die gently, exhaling their outer layers into space. Some explode in a supernova,
                        flinging their contents into space at anywhere from 9,000 to 25,000 miles (15,000 to 40,000
                        kilometers) per second.

                        When a star has a lot of mass ― at least five times that of our Sun ― or is part of a binary
                        system in which a white dwarf star can gravitationally pull mass from a companion star, it can
                        explode with the brightness of 10 billion Suns. Supernova remnants consist of material from the
                        exploded star and any interstellar material it sweeps up in its path.

                        The new debris from the explosion and material ejected by the star earlier in its life collide,
                        heating up in the shock until it glows with x-rays. Supernova remnants’ glow can also be powered
                        by the stellar wind of a pulsar ― a rapidly spinning neutron star created from the core of the
                        exploded star. The pulsar emits electrons that interact with the magnetic field it produces, a
                        process called synchrotron radiation, and emits X-rays, visible light and radio waves.

                        The Crab Nebula is an example of a supernova remnant. The explosion that created it in the year
                        1054 was so bright that for weeks it could be seen even in the daytime sky, and it was recorded
                        by astronomers across the world. The material from the star is still rushing outward at around 3
                        million mph (4.8 million kph).

                    <h2> Absorption Nebulae</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        Absorption nebulae or dark nebulae are clouds of gas and dust that don’t emit or reflect light,
                        but block light coming from behind them. These nebulae tend to contain large amounts of dust,
                        which allows them to absorb visible light from stars or nebulae beyond them. Astronomer William
                        Herschel, discussing these seemingly empty spots in the late 1700s, called them “a hole in the
                        sky.”

                        Included among absorption nebulae are objects like Bok globules, small, cold clouds of gas and
                        dense cosmic dust. Some Bok globules have been found to have warm cores, which would be caused
                        by star formation inside, and further observation has indicated the presence of multiple stars
                        of varying ages, suggesting a slow, ongoing star formation process.

                        The space between stars is dotted with twisting towers studded with stars, unblinking eyes,
                        ethereal ribbons, and floating bubbles. These fantastical shapes, some of the universe’s most
                        visually stunning constructions, are nebulae, clouds of gas and dust that can be the birthplace
                        of stars, the scene of their demise ― and sometimes both.

                        Nebulae are made up of gas ― primarily hydrogen and helium ― and fine cosmic dust. These clouds
                        are part of the interstellar medium of extremely low-density gas and dust that exists between
                        stars in the void of space, material so dispersed through the vastness of the cosmos that it can
                        have a density as low as 0.1 atoms per cubic centimeter. In contrast, a cubic centimeter of the
                        air we breathe on Earth would contain about 10 million trillion molecules.

                        Nebulae happen in places where the interstellar medium has become dense enough to form clouds.
                        That could be because gravity has pulled the gas and dust together, or because stars have died
                        and spewed their contents into the cosmos. Several types of nebulae exist, and each individual
                        nebula is a unique showcase of the phenomena and processes happening within. They often live
                        side by side, with smaller nebulae populating larger clouds of gas and dust to form giant
                        complexes of star birth and death.
