            <p style="font-weight:200;">
                Billions of trillions of stars illuminate the galaxies of our universe. Each brilliant ball of hydrogen
                and helium is born within a cloud of gas and dust called a nebula. Deep within these clouds, knots can
                form, pulling in gas and dust until they become massive enough to collapse under their own gravitational
                attraction. During the collapse, the center of the knot heats up to form a hot core called a protostar.
                The protostar continues to gather dust and gas, taking millions of years to mature into an adult star
                like our Sun. All the while, heat energy from the core provides enough outward pressure to keep the star
                from collapsing under the inward gravitational pressure of its own mass. In the hot core, thousands of
                quintillions of nuclear fusion reactions convert hydrogen atoms to helium atoms each second, giving off
                massive quantities of energy that make the star shine brightly.

                Bright-white stars fill the center of the image. They are backlit by a blue cloud of gas and dust. Right
                side of the image holds a rusty-red cloud with dark dust lanes.

                Stars often form in groups or clusters from the same nebulae. Over time, the leftover dust and gas
                around a star blow away or form into other cosmic bodies like planets, asteroids, and comets. Gravity
                then pulls the young stars together, and they begin to orbit each other. Star clusters can contain as
                few as ten stars or as many as millions of stars. There are three main types of star clusters, and
                Hubble has imaged each of them over its three decades of operation.

                    <p class="pb-4">
                        Open clusters contain between a few dozen and a few thousand stars, all formed from the same
                        initial cloud of gas and dust. The density of stars is low enough in these clusters that
                        individual stars are visible with a telescope, or sometimes the unaided eye, giving them an
                        “open” appearance. Most open clusters reside in the arms of spiral galaxies, and their stars are
                        usually relatively young. Their shape is more irregular than spherical, with large amounts of
                        gas between the stars. Over time, as these clusters rotate around a galaxy, gravitational
                        disruptions from passing cosmic objects can cause the stars to disperse. The Milky Way is home
                        to more than a thousand of these clusters, and even our Sun may have formed in an open cluster.

                    <h2>Globular Clusters</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        Globular clusters are much larger and denser than open clusters, containing several thousand to
                        millions of stars all formed from a shared nebula. Unlike open clusters, the density of stars at
                        their centers is so high that individual stars are hard to discern, even with powerful
                        telescopes. Globular clusters lie on the dusty outskirts of galaxies and their stars are older
                        than those in open clusters. In fact, globular clusters contain some of the oldest known stars
                        in a galaxy. Because old stars tend to have a reddish glow, globular clusters generally appear
                        redder than open clusters.

                        The large number of stars in a relatively small area causes the shape of a globular cluster to
                        appear spherical, as stars’ intense gravitational attraction pulls them together. These
                        gravitational ties grant globular clusters more stability than open clusters, helping them keep
                        their structure instead of breaking up over time. The Milky Way alone has over 150 globular
                        clusters, and our nearest neighboring galaxy Andromeda has over 400.

                    <h2>Embedded Clusters</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        Embedded clusters are a precursor to open and globular clusters. As the youngest type of star
                        cluster, they contain newly born and forming stars surrounded by cosmic gas and dust. As with
                        open and globular clusters, all of the stars formed from the same initial nebula. Embedded
                        clusters are likely the basic unit of star formation since a significant fraction of all stars
                        form within them. Once star formation ends, embedded clusters resemble open clusters, but are
                        often disrupted by passing objects due to their weaker gravitational bonds. The embedded phase
                        typically lasts between 2-7 million years. Since embedded clusters are heavily obscured by dust,
                        they are rarely observed in visible wavelengths of light. However, Hubble’s infrared instruments
                        can detect the longer wavelengths of infrared light that aren’t as easily scattered by clouds of
                        gas and dust. Hubble’s unique capabilities are essential for learning more about these young
                        clusters.

                    <h2>Hubble’s Impact</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        Much of what scientists know today about stellar science has roots in Hubble’s three decades of
                        observations. Astronomers use the telescope to study the composition of star clusters, how they
                        evolve, and how gravity influences them. Hubble is also instrumental in distinguishing
                        individual stars within a cluster and helped astronomers make early observations of white dwarfs
                        – the dense, hot cores of stars that have exhausted their nuclear fuel – in a globular cluster.
                        The telescope also expanded our understanding of stars known as blue stragglers, a type of star
                        that can pull matter off of its neighbor, gaining extra fuel and burning brighter as a result.
                        In 2021, Hubble data provided evidence supporting the existence of a collection of small black
                        holes in the center of the globular cluster NGC 6397. Though contested, this evidence may
                        provide support for the theory that the merger of small black holes is an important source of
                        gravitational waves, which are only detected on Earth as a result of dramatic collision events
                        like the ones occurring in NGC 6397.

                        Perhaps the most important piece of star cluster knowledge revealed by Hubble is that clusters
                        can contain several generations of stars, making them far more complex than previously thought.
                        Since the stars within a cluster likely form from the same cloud of gas and dust, discovering
                        varying stellar ages within the same cluster has the potential to fundamentally alter our
                        understanding of star formation. Future observations by Hubble will further the depths of our
                        knowledge about star clusters, helping us to grasp the complexity, beauty, and remaining mystery
                        of the stars illuminating our universe.

                    <p class="pb-4">
                        The origin of globular clusters and their role in galactic evolution are unclear. Some are among
                        the oldest objects in their galaxies and even the universe, constraining estimates of the
                        universe's age. Star clusters were formerly thought to consist of stars that all formed at the
                        same time from one star-forming nebula, but nearly all globular clusters contain stars that
                        formed at different times, or that have differing compositions. Some clusters may have had
                        multiple episodes of star formation, and some may be remnants of smaller galaxies captured by
                        larger galaxies.
