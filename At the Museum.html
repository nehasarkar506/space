                        Telescope as well as several “satellite” units that not only provide viewers with a hands-on experience
                        with the same technology that allows Hubble to gaze at distant galaxies, but also feature Hubble’s
                        contributions to the exploration of planets, stars, galaxies and the universe. Exhibit viewers will
                        learn of the various instruments aboard the telescope and the role that each of them plays in providing
                        exciting new images and discoveries. Observers will also get a glimpse into the various hurdles that
                        Hubble has faced in its career and the role that astronauts have played in repairing and servicing the
                        satellite. The exhibit contains images and data taken by Hubble of planets, galaxies, regions around
                        black holes and many other fascinating cosmic entities that have captivated the minds of scientists for
                        centuries. Experience the life and history of the Hubble Space Telescope through this interactive and
                        stunning exhibit, provided free of charge to any organization willing to share in the splendors of its
                        discoveries.
