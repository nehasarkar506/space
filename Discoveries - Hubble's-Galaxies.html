                Our Sun is just one of a vast number of stars within a galaxy called the Milky Way, which in turn is
                only one of the billions of galaxies in our universe. These massive cosmic neighborhoods, made up of
                stars, dust, and gas held together by gravity, come in a variety of sizes, from dwarf galaxies
                containing as few as 100 million stars to giant galaxies of more than a trillion stars. Astronomers
                generally classify galaxies into three major categories: spiral – like our Milky Way – elliptical, and
                irregular.
                These galaxies span a wide range of sizes, from dwarf galaxies containing as few as 100 million stars to

                    <h2>Spiral Galaxies</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        Spiral galaxies have winding spiral arms that make them look a little like massive pinwheels.
                        These disks of stars, gas, and dust have bright bulges in their centers made up primarily of
                        older and dimmer stars. Their whirled arms are typically full of gas and dust, which helps give
                        rise to the bright, younger stars visible throughout their length. Spiral galaxies are actively
                        forming stars and make up a large amount of all the galaxies in our nearby universe.

                        Spiral galaxies can be further divided into two groups: normal spirals and barred spirals. In
                        barred spirals, a bar of stars runs through the central bulge of the galaxy. The arms of barred
                        spirals usually start at the end of the bar instead of the bulge. Our Milky Way is thought to be
                        a barred spiral galaxy.

                    <h2>Elliptical Galaxies</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        Elliptical galaxies are the biggest and most common galaxies in our universe. The shapes of
                        these galaxies range from circular to very elongated. Galaxies are thought to form and grow by
                        collisions and mergers, and elliptical galaxies may be the ultimate result of this process,
                        which explains why they are so abundant. Compared to other types of galaxies, elliptical
                        galaxies have smaller portions of gas and dust, contain older stars, and don’t form many new
                        stars. The largest and rarest of these galaxies – known as giant ellipticals – are about 300,000
                        light-years across. More commonly spotted are dwarf ellipticals, which in comparison are only a
                        few thousand light-years wide.

                    <h2>Irregular Galaxies</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        Irregular galaxies don’t contain much dust, and lack a defined shape. Astronomers often see
                        irregular galaxies as they peer deeply into the universe. These galaxies are abundant in the
                        early universe, in the era before spirals and ellipticals developed. As irregular galaxies
                        collide and merge with other galaxies throughout time, they are thought to develop structure and
                        become the spiral and elliptical galaxies we see in today’s universe.

                        In addition to these three big categories, astronomers have also observed many unusually shaped
                        galaxies that appear to be in a transitory or “in-between” phase of galactic evolution,
                        including galaxies that are colliding or interacting with each other, pulled together by
                        gravity.

                    <p class="pb-4">
                        For over three decades, the Hubble Space Telescope has helped scientists gain a greater
                        understanding of how galaxies form and evolve. The telescope has observed some of the farthest
                        galaxies ever seen, thanks to its iconic deep field imagery. Among its famous observations is
                        the Hubble Ultra Deep field, the deepest image of the universe ever made at visible and
                        near-infrared wavelengths, and revealed over 10,000 galaxies in a small patch of sky.

                        Thanks to Hubble’s observations, astronomers have traced the evolution and formation of
                        galaxies, discovered that most galaxies contain supermassive black holes, and mapped the
                        presence of the mysterious dark matter that makes up most of the universe’s mass and structure.
                        Hubble has viewed galaxies that spin backwards, unusually close galaxies dancing together before
                        colliding to form a giant ellpitical, and ring-shaped galaxies that may have formed through
                        gravitational interactions with nearby or passing galaxies. The sheer diversity of the galaxies
                        observed by Hubble has vastly increased our understanding of the universe and its shining
                        islands of stars.

                        Hubble’s observations of galaxies continue today, revealing the history of galaxies throughout
                        the universe and shedding light on how our galaxy – and with it, our tiny corner of the cosmos –
                        came into being.

                    <h2>Dark Matter</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the late 1970s, astronomer Vera Rubin made the surprising discovery of dark matter. She was
                        studying how galaxies spin when she realized the vast spiral Andromeda Galaxy seemed to be
                        rotating strangely. In an apparent violation of Newton and Kepler’s Laws, the material at the
                        galaxy’s edges was moving just as fast as the material near the center, even though most of the
                        mass she could see was concentrated at the center. Some extra non-visible mass, dubbed dark
                        matter, appeared to be holding the galaxy together. She soon discovered that a huge halo of dark
                        matter was present in galaxy after galaxy that she examined.

                        Dense packed stars extend from the inner hub of the galaxy


                        Some of the best evidence for the existence of dark matter comes from galaxy cluster 1E
                        0657-556, also known as the Bullet Cluster. This cluster was formed after the collision of two
                        large clusters of galaxies, one of the most energetic events known in the universe since the big
                        bang. Because the major components of the cluster pair — stars, gas and the apparent dark matter
                        — behave differently during collision, scientists were able to study them separately.

                <div class="col-12 mb-5">
                    <p> The galaxies’ stars, which the Hubble and Magellan telescopes observed in visible light, were
                        mostly unaffected by the collision, and passed right through. The hot gas from the two colliding
                        clusters, seen in X-ray wavelengths by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, contains most of the
                        cluster pair’s normal matter. Because the gases interact electromagnetically, the gases of both
                        clusters slowed down much more than the stars. The third element in this collision, the dark
                        matter, was detected indirectly by the gravitational lensing of background objects.

                        The dark matter by definition does not emit, reflect, or refract any type of light — it’s dark!
                        So during the collision, the dark matter clumps from the two clusters move ahead of the hot gas
                        (most of the normal matter), producing a separation of dark matter and normal matter.
                        Gravitational lensing distorts light more significantly around objects with larger masses. If
                        hot gas were the most massive component in the clusters, such an effect would not be seen.
                        Instead, these observations show that dark matter — something that we can’t see but that must
                        have mass to have such a strong gravitational effect — must exist.</p>

                    <h2>Galaxy Collisions</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        While the distances between galaxies seem large, so too are galaxies’ diameters. Compared to
                        stars, galaxies are relatively close to one another. They interact and even collide. When
                        galaxies collide, they pass through each other; their stars don’t crash into each other because
                        of the immense distances between them. However, gravitational interactions between colliding
                        galaxies could create new waves of star formation, supernovas and even black holes. Collisions
                        do distort a galaxy’s shape and computer models show that collisions between spiral galaxies can
                        eventually make ellipticals.

                        2 merging spiral galaxies contain tens of thousands of stars


                        Computer simulations derived from Hubble data show that it will take an additional two billion
                        years or more after the encounter for the interacting galaxies to completely merge under the tug
                        of gravity. They will reshape into a single elliptical galaxy similar to the kind commonly seen
                        in the local universe. Simulations show that our solar system will probably be tossed much
                        farther from the galactic core than it is today.

                        To make matters more complicated, the third largest galaxy in the Local Group, the Triangulum
                        galaxy or M33, will join in the collision and perhaps later merge with the Andromeda/Milky Way
                        pair. There is a small chance that M33 will hit the Milky Way first.

                    <h2>Galaxy Formation</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        The appearance and make-up of galaxies are shaped over billions of years by interactions with
                        groups of stars and other galaxies. While we don't know for certain how galaxies formed and took
                        the many shapes that we presently see, we have some ideas about their origins and evolution.
                        Using supercomputers, scientists can look back in time and simulate how a galaxy may have formed
                        in the early universe and grown into what we see today.

                        Astronomer Edwin Hubble’s observations led to the idea that the universe is expanding.
                        Scientists estimate the age of the universe at 13.8 billion years based on the rate of
                        expansion. Because the deeper you look into space, the further you see back in time, we can
                        conclude that galaxies several billions of light-years away formed fairly soon after the big
                        bang. While most galaxies formed early, data indicates that some galaxies have formed within the
                        past few billion years — relatively recently in cosmic terms.

                        The early universe was filled mainly with hydrogen, helium, and dark matter, with some areas
                        slightly denser than others. These dense areas eventually collapsed, allowing the hydrogen and
                        helium to accumulate in clumps of dark matter swirling through space and the first stars and
                        galaxies to form. While Hubble is unable to see the very first galaxies, it can track the
                        development of galaxies over much of cosmic time.
