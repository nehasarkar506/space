                    <p style="font-size: 18px;text-align: center;">Since the
                        dawn of civilization, humans have been limited in
                        their understanding of the universe by their vision
                        and imagination. The telescope enhanced our vision
                        and
                        tempered our pride, as observations by Copernicus,
                        Galileo,
                        and Kepler in the 16th and 17th centuries rebuffed
                        the millennia-old conceit that Earth is the center
                        of the universe, spearheading the Scientific
                        Revolution.</p>

                It has been compiled, and is regularly reviewed, by staff of
                ESA/Hubble. A couple of quick notes before we get you to all
                the amazing images though.
                For this commemorative issue, we asked a number of
                scientists to share their thoughts about the Hubble Space
                Telescope.
                <br>“No matter what Hubble reveals — planets, dense star
                fields, colorful interstellar nebulae, deadly black holes,
                graceful colliding galaxies, the large-scale structure of
                the Universe — each image establishes your own private vista
                on the cosmos.”

                        <p>The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has revisited
                            one of its most iconic and popular images: the
                            Eagle Nebula’s Pillars of Creation. This image
                            shows the pillars as seen in visible light,
                            capturing the multi-coloured glow of gas clouds,
                            wispy tendrils of dark cosmic dust, and the
                            rust-coloured elephants’ trunks of the nebula’s
                            famous pillars.

                            The dust and gas in the pillars is seared by the
                            intense radiation from young stars and eroded by
                            strong winds from massive nearby stars. With
                            these new images comes better contrast and a
                            clearer view for astronomers to study how the
                            structure of the pillars is changing over time.

                        <p>This image of a pair of interacting galaxies
                            called Arp 273 was released to celebrate the
                            21st anniversary of the launch of the Hubble
                            Space Telescope.

                            The distorted shape of the larger of the two
                            galaxies shows signs of tidal interactions with
                            the smaller of the two. It is thought that the
                            smaller galaxy has actually passed through the
                            larger one
                            “Hubble has become ‘The People’s Telescope,’ and
                            has explored our solar system and beyond with
                            acuity, capability, and power. It is hard to
                            imagine a world without Hubble, without the
                            beauty that Hubble has brought, without the
                            wonders that Hubble has shared.
                            We are fortunate to have been witness to this
                            amazing machine.”

                        <p>“There’s an art to making beautiful images from
                            scientific data, and the Hubble team has
                            mastered it. Hubble also came of age at the same
                            time as the internet, which created a great
                            opportunity to distribute large format, high
                            resolution images that are absolutely stunning
                            on computer desktops and screen savers. Before
                            that most people only saw astronomy images
                            published in books or newspapers.

                            “Hubble also had a fairly dramatic beginning,
                            with the discovery of the flawed mirror and the
                            subsequent mission where astronauts actually
                            traveled to the telescope in order to repair it.

                            “It is our eye on the universe, but at the same
                            time it is an actual object in space that we can
                            visit and even touch, which helps to bring the
                            images it produces a little closer to home.”</p>

                        <p>
                            Hubble has snapped the best ever image of the
                            Antennae Galaxies. Hubble has released images of
                            these stunning galaxies twice before, once using
                            observations from its Wide Field and Planetary
                            Camera 2 (WFPC2) in 1997, and again in 2006 from
                            the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). Each of
                            Hubble’s images of the Antennae Galaxies has
                            been better than the last, due to upgrades made
                            during the famous servicing missions, the last
                            of which took place in 2009.

                            The galaxies — also known as NGC 4038 and NGC
                            4039 — are locked in a deadly embrace. Once
                            normal, sedate spiral galaxies like the Milky
                            Way, the pair have spent the past few hundred
                            million years sparring with one another. This
                            clash is so violent that stars have been ripped
                            from their host galaxies to form a streaming arc
                            between the two. In wide-field images of the
                            pair the reason for their name becomes clear —
                            far-flung stars and streamers of gas stretch out
                            into space, creating long tidal tails
                            reminiscent of antennae.

                        <p>This Hubble image, captured and released to
                            celebrate the telescope’s 23rd year in orbit,
                            shows part of the sky in the constellation of
                            Orion (The Hunter). Rising like a giant seahorse
                            from turbulent waves of dust and gas is the
                            Horsehead Nebula, otherwise known as Barnard 33.

                            This image shows the region in infrared light,
                            which has longer wavelengths than visible light
                            and can pierce through the dusty material that
                            usually obscures the nebula’s inner regions. The
                            result is a rather ethereal and fragile-looking
                            structure, made of delicate folds of gas — very
                            different to the nebula’s appearance in visible
                            light.
                            I am one of the professional astronomers from
                            the generation that grew while the amazing
                            pictures of Hubble were released. As a young
                            girl I heard a talk in a planetarium about
                            supernova, red giants, white dwarfs, black holes
                            which I found extremely fascinating. This was
                            just around the time that the Hubble was
                            repaired and its first astonishing images were
                            released to the public.

                        <p>This stunning image of NGC 1275 was taken using Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys in July
                            and August 2006. It provides amazing detail and resolution of the fragile filamentary
                            structures, which show up as a reddish lacy structure surrounding the central bright galaxy
                            NGC 1275. These filaments are cool despite being surrounded by gas that is around 55 million
                            degrees Celsius hot. They are suspended in a magnetic field which maintains their structure
                            and demonstrates how energy from the central black hole is transferred to the surrounding
                            gas.

                            By observing the filamentary structure, astronomers were, for the first time, able to
                            estimate the magnetic field’s strength. Using this information they demonstrated how the
                            extragalactic magnetic fields have maintained the structure of the filaments against
                            collapse caused by either gravitational forces or the violence of the surrounding cluster
                            during their 100-million-year lifetime.

                            The filaments seen here can be a gaping 200 000 light-years long. The entire image is
                            approximately 260 000 light-years across.

                        <h5>7. HUBBLE ULTRA DEEP FIELD IS FILLED WITH GALAXIES</h5>
                        <p>Galaxies, galaxies everywhere – as far as the Hubble Space Telescope can see. This view of nearly 10,000 galaxies is the deepest visible-light image of the cosmos. Called the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, this galaxy-studded view represents a “deep” core sample of the universe, cutting across billions of light-years.

                            The snapshot includes galaxies of various ages, sizes, shapes, and colours. The smallest, reddest galaxies, about 100, may be among the most distant known, existing when the universe was just 800 million years old. The nearest galaxies – the larger, brighter, well-defined spirals and ellipticals – thrived about 1 billion years ago, when the cosmos was 13 billion years old.
                            
                            In vibrant contrast to the rich harvest of classic spiral and elliptical galaxies, there is a zoo of oddball galaxies littering the field. Some look like toothpicks; others like links on a bracelet. A few appear to be interacting. These oddball galaxies chronicle a period when the universe was younger and more chaotic.
                            
                            In ground-based photographs, the patch of sky in which the galaxies reside (just one-tenth the diameter of the full Moon) is largely empty. Located in the constellation Fornax, the region is so empty that only a handful of stars within the Milky Way galaxy can be seen in the image.
                            
                            The image required 800 exposures taken over the course of 400 Hubble orbits around Earth. The total amount of exposure time was 11.3 days, taken between Sept. 24, 2003 and Jan. 16, 2004.

                        <p>Hubble has trained its razor-sharp eye on one of the universe’s most stately and photogenic galaxies, the Sombrero galaxy, Messier 104 (M104). The galaxy’s hallmark is a brilliant white, bulbous core encircled by the thick dust lanes comprising the spiral structure of the galaxy. As seen from Earth, the galaxy is tilted nearly edge-on. We view it from just six degrees north of its equatorial plane. This brilliant galaxy was named the Sombrero because of its resemblance to the broad rim and high-topped Mexican hat.

                            At a relatively bright magnitude of +8, M104 is just beyond the limit of naked-eye visibility and is easily seen through small telescopes. The Sombrero lies at the southern edge of the rich Virgo cluster of galaxies and is one of the most massive objects in that group, equivalent to 800 billion suns. The galaxy is 50,000 light-years across and is located 28 million light-years from Earth.

                        <p>
                            have fond memories of the Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacts with Jupiter in 1994 [#52]. Many scientists, including myself, spent all week at the Space Telescope Science Institute analyzing the data and generating color images and maps of the impact scars in Jupiter’s clouds. Because the telescope mirror had recently been corrected, the beautiful details visible in every image were amazing.

“Since then, I find that every new image is just as exciting and awe-inspiring. Perhaps one of my favorite images of Jupiter is from 2014 [#97]. We were using Hubble to study changes in the Great Red Spot, and when we began to process the images, we realized Ganymede’s shadow was directly in the way!

“It was just incredibly poor timing, but it made for a spectacular and fun image.”

                            This image is the largest image ever taken with Hubble’s WFPC2 camera. It was assembled from 24 individual exposures taken with the telescope and is the highest resolution image of the entire Crab Nebula ever made.
                            
                            “Hubble joined up a thousand years of astronomy, from the discovery of the supernova in 1054 that produced the Crab pulsar to the extraordinarily detailed images of its remnant taken with WFPC2 in 1999/2000.”

                        <p>This celestial object looks like a delicate butterfly. But it is far from serene. What resemble dainty butterfly wings are actually roiling cauldrons of gas heated to nearly 20 000 degrees Celsius. The gas is tearing across space at more than 950 000 kilometres per hour — fast enough to travel from Earth to the Moon in 24 minutes!

                            A dying star that was once about five times the mass of the Sun is at the centre of this fury. It has ejected its envelope of gases and is now unleashing a stream of ultraviolet radiation that is making the cast-off material glow. This object is an example of a planetary nebula, so-named because many of them have a round appearance resembling that of a planet when viewed through a small telescope.
                            
                            The Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) aboard the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, snapped this image of the planetary nebula, catalogued as NGC 6302, but more popularly called the Bug Nebula or the Butterfly Nebula.

                        <p>This dramatic image offers a peek inside a cavern of roiling dust and gas where thousands of stars are forming. The image, taken by the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope, represents the sharpest view ever taken of this region, called the Orion Nebula. More than 3,000 stars of various sizes appear in this image. Some of them have never been seen in visible light. These stars reside in a dramatic dust-and-gas landscape of plateaus, mountains, and valleys that are reminiscent of the Grand Canyon.

                            The Orion Nebula is a picture book of star formation, from the massive, young stars that are shaping the nebula to the pillars of dense gas that may be the homes of budding stars. The bright central region is the home of the four heftiest stars in the nebula. The stars are called the Trapezium because they are arranged in a trapezoid pattern. Ultraviolet light unleashed by these stars is carving a cavity in the nebula and disrupting the growth of hundreds of smaller stars. Located near the Trapezium stars are stars still young enough to have disks of material encircling them. 
                            These disks are called protoplanetary disks or “proplyds” and are too small to see clearly in this image. The disks are the building blocks of solar systems.

                        <p>This Hubble Space Telescope view shows one of the most dynamic and intricately detailed star-forming regions in space, located 210,000 light-years away in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way. At the centre of the region is a brilliant star cluster called NGC 346. A dramatic structure of arched, ragged filaments with a distinct ridge surrounds the cluster.

                            A torrent of radiation from the hot stars in the cluster NGC 346, at the centre of this Hubble image, eats into denser areas around it, creating a fantasy sculpture of dust and gas. The dark, intricately beaded edge of the ridge, seen in silhouette, is particularly dramatic. It contains several small dust globules that point back towards the central cluster, like windsocks caught in a gale.

                        <p>
                            The graceful, winding arms of the majestic spiral galaxy M51 (NGC 5194) appear like a grand spiral staircase sweeping through space. They are actually long lanes of stars and gas laced with dust.

                            This sharpest-ever image, taken in January 2005 with the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope, illustrates a spiral galaxy’s grand design, from its curving spiral arms, where young stars reside, to its yellowish central core, a home of older stars. The galaxy is nicknamed the Whirlpool because of its swirling structure.
                            
                            The Whirlpool’s most striking feature is its two curving arms, a hallmark of so-called grand-design spiral galaxies. Many spiral galaxies possess numerous, loosely shaped arms that make their spiral structure less pronounced. These arms serve an important purpose in spiral galaxies. They are star-formation factories, compressing hydrogen gas and creating clusters of new stars. In the Whirlpool, the assembly line begins with the dark clouds of gas on the inner edge, then moves to bright pink star-forming regions, and ends with the brilliant blue star clusters along the outer edge.
                            
                            The Whirlpool is one of astronomy’s galactic darlings. Located approximately 25 million light-years away in the constellation Canes Venatici (the Hunting Dogs), the Whirlpool’s beautiful face-on view and closeness to Earth allow astronomers to study a classic spiral galaxy’s structure and star-forming processes.

                        <p>Appearing like a winged fairy-tale creature poised on a pedestal, this object is actually a billowing tower of cold gas and dust rising from a stellar nursery called the Eagle Nebula. The soaring tower is 9.5 light-years or about 90 trillion kilometres high, about twice the distance from our Sun to the next nearest star.

                            Stars in the Eagle Nebula are born in clouds of cold hydrogen gas that reside in chaotic neighbourhoods, where energy from young stars sculpts fantasy-like landscapes in the gas. The tower may be a giant incubator for those newborn stars. A torrent of ultraviolet light from a band of massive, hot, young stars [off the top of the image] is eroding the pillar.
                            
                            The starlight also is responsible for illuminating the tower’s rough surface. Ghostly streamers of gas can be seen boiling off this surface, creating the haze around the structure and highlighting its three-dimensional shape. The column is silhouetted against the background glow of more distant gas.
                            
                            Inside the gaseous tower, stars may be forming. Some of those stars may have been created by dense gas collapsing under gravity. Other stars may be forming due to pressure from gas that has been heated by the neighbouring hot stars.
