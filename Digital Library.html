                    <p >
                        Since 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope has given the world a new view of the universe.
                        Successful beyond all expectations, the telescope is now more technologically advanced than when
                        it was launched, thanks to the maintenance and upgrades of five NASA space shuttle servicing
                        missions. Hubble’s scientific contributions appear in textbooks, museums and media sites
                        worldwide, and Hubble imagery has influenced art, dance, music, cinema and fashion. This
                        image-packed, fixed-layout e-book provides an overview of the Hubble Space Telescope with
                        sections that briefly describe its history, design, operation, science, technology transfers and
                        cultural impact.

                        ever seen. These discoveries are helping us understand how galaxies evolve and how the universe
                        itself has come to be the way it is today.
