        The Hubble Space Telescope has a sophisticated communications system
        that enables the telescope to receive commands from Earth-bound
        controllers and to transmit large amounts of scientific and
        engineering data back to the ground. Before any commands can be sent
        to Hubble to tell it what astronomical targets to observe, those
        targets must first be identified and scheduled by the Space Telescope
        Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. The schedule of commands is
        then sent to the Space Telescope Operations Control Center (STOCC) at
        NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, which
        operates and commands Hubble. To communicate with Hubble, the STOCC
        utilizes NASA’s Space Network. This network consists of a
        constellation of satellites in geosynchronous orbit named the Tracking
        and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS) as well as the ground facilities that
        support and communicate with those satellites. Hubble commands are
        transmitted from the STOCC and routed through dedicated radio dishes
        at the White Sands Complex (a Space Network facility near White Sands,
        New Mexico) to the TDRS spacecraft and then to Hubble.

          <h2>Data on the Move</h2>
          <p>
            TDRS serves as a relay for commands and data going to and from
            Hubble. All of these transmissions are done in the S-band, a
            specific radio frequency range. The satellites send and receive
            signals through two different types of antennas, called
            multiple-access and single-access antennas. The terms
            “multiple-access” and “single-access” refer to the number of users
            that can access an antenna at any moment. (As their names imply,
            the multiple-access antenna can be utilized by multiple users
            simultaneously, while the single-access antenna is limited to a
            single user.) The two types of antennas offer different signal
            transmission speeds, or data rates. The data rate for a
            single-access antenna is higher than that of a multiple-access
            antenna. A high data rate is important for transferring large
            amounts of information in a timely manner.

        </div>

        <div class="col-12">
          <p> Hubble operates 24
            hours a day, every day of the year, collecting an average of 18
            gigabytes of science data each week. That’s more than 3 DVDs of
            data per day. Therefore, the single-access antennas on TDRS, which
            have a higher data rate, are used to relay the large volumes of
            observational data from Hubble back to Earth. Commands do not
            require such high data rates and can be sent to Hubble using
            either type of antenna. Similarly, Hubble has two types of
            antennas to send and receive signals: high-gain antennas (HGAs)
            and low-gain antennas (LGAs). The LGAs are small, stationary,
            spiral cone antennas that can send and receive signals in every
            direction. All commands to Hubble are received through the LGAs,
            which can receive signals from both types of TDRS antennas. When
            TDRS relays a signal from Earth to Hubble, Hubble receives the
            signal through an LGA, which passes the signal along to the
            onboard computer. The computer then interprets and executes the
            commands it receives. The HGAs are dish-shaped parabolic
            reflectors that can send more information out at once than the
            LGAs can. As a result, the HGAs are used to transmit large amounts
            of data, including the images that the telescope gathers. The HGAs
            can transmit to both the multiple-access and single-access
            antennas on TDRS, and are reserved for signal transmission.
            Sometimes, Hubble encounters a problem communicating with the
            Space Network. Usually, this is caused by a temporary issue with
            the Hubble spacecraft, difficulty connecting with TDRS, or a
            problem at the White Sands Complex. When these troubles occur,
            Hubble can communicate with the Near Earth Network (formerly known
            as the Ground Network). The field of view for the Near Earth
            Network’s ground antennas is very small compared to that of a
            geosynchronous spacecraft. Therefore, the Near Earth Network
            offers fewer and shorter communication windows than the Space
            Network, limiting how much data can be transmitted, so Hubble only
            utilizes it when necessary.

          <h2>Data Types</h2>
          <p>
            Hubble transmits four main types of data: real-time science,
            real-time engineering, recorded science and recorded engineering.
            For these transmissions, Hubble utilizes two different types of
            transmitters to send the data back to Earth: the Multiple-Access
            Transponders (MATs) and the S-Band Single-Access Transmitters
            (SSATs). The SSATs transmit real-time science, recorded science
            and recorded engineering information at 1 Mbps. The MATs have two
            channels, I and Q, which can be transmitted simultaneously. The
            I-channel can send down real-time science and memory dumps at 4
            Kbps, while the Q-channel can transmit real-time engineering at
            either 4 or 32 Kbps. The HGAs combine the signals from both
            transmitters into one output, which is concentrated by the antenna
            into a narrow beam. Therefore, the HGAs must be able to point
            directly at a TDRS spacecraft. Hubble has an Antenna Pointing
            System (APS) to accomplish this task. Connected to the onboard
            computer, the APS can manipulate the HGAs along two axes so that
            the antenna can point directly at the targeted satellite. Once the
            Space Network receives data from Hubble, it forwards the data to
            the White Sands Complex. From there, the information from Hubble
            is sent to the STOCC, which performs quality checks on the
            information. All scientific data is then forwarded to STScI, where
            it is processed, archived and distributed to scientists and the
            public.
