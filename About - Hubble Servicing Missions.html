            <p style="font-weight: 200">
                Launched in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope was designed for periodic servicing to keep it running
                smoothly and extend its life. Between 1993 and 2009, astronauts visited Hubble five times to replace
                limited-life items such as batteries, gyroscopes and electronic boxes, and to install state-of-the-art
                science instruments. Each time astronauts visited Hubble, they left it a more capable, more productive
                observatory.

                Because Hubble was designed to be serviced, the items astronauts replaced were easily accessible.
                Ranging in size from a shoebox to a telephone booth, most of these items could be removed or installed
                using special wrenches and power tools.

                On-orbit servicing has ensured Hubble’s health and productivity well into the 21st century, allowing
                this unique scientific resource to continue making exciting discoveries as it explores the universe.

                    <p class="pb-4">

                        Hubble Images of M100 Before and After Repair
                        Shortly after the Hubble Space Telescope was deployed in 1990, the observatory's primary mirror
                        was discovered to have an aberration that affected the clarity of the telescope's early images.
                        Fortunately, Hubble was the first telescope designed to be visited in space by astronauts to
                        perform repairs, replace parts and update its technology with new instruments. Astronauts first
                        visited Hubble in orbit in December 1993. Including that trip, there have been five astronaut
                        servicing missions to Hubble.<br>

                        The servicing missions involved intensive coordination between NASA's Kennedy Space Center in
                        Florida, Johnson Space Center in Texas, and Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Preparation
                        activities included astronaut training at all three centers; simulations of telescope operations
                        during the mission at the Space Telescope Operations Control Center (STOCC) at Goddard; testing
                        and preparing instruments and hardware for flight at Goddard; and preparing the space shuttle
                        for launch, flight and landing at Kennedy.<br>

                        During the missions, operations took place primarily at Johnson and in Goddard's STOCC.
                        Johnson’s Mission Control Center (MCC) monitored every aspect of the space shuttle and
                        astronauts, including spacewalks, procedures and schedules, crew activities and health, and
                        in-cabin and cargo bay systems and experiments. The STOCC ground crew handled telescope
                        operations, sending commands to Hubble to place the instruments into “safe hold” (hibernation),
                        close the aperture door (which covers the precious optical components), and perform maneuvers to
                        position the telescope for grappling by the shuttle’s robotic arm, operated by astronauts to
                        bring Hubble into the shuttle’s payload bay.<br>

                        After every new system part or science instrument was installed, STOCC personnel performed tests
                        to make sure each instrument and component had power and operated as it should. During the
                        astronauts' sleep cycles, the STOCC team performed more detailed tests on the newly installed
                        components to determine whether additional service from astronauts would be required.<br>

                        After all the servicing tasks had been performed via a three- to five-day series of spacewalks,
                        STOCC controllers and Johnson Mission Control prepared the telescope for release. Often this
                        also involved using the shuttle’s thrusters to carry Hubble into a slightly higher orbit before
                        its release, a step that prolonged Hubble's life by keeping it from naturally deorbiting due to
                        atmospheric drag.<br>

                        The astronaut crew then used the shuttle’s robotic arm to slowly raise Hubble from the payload
                        bay and out into space, where controllers at STOCC opened Hubble's aperture door and made sure
                        the telescope was functioning on its own. Returning Hubble to full science observations after a
                        servicing mission usually took a few months.<br>

                    <ol>

                        <li> <b> Servicing Mission 1 (SM1): Dec. 2-13, 1993 </b><br>
                            The first opportunity to conduct planned maintenance on the telescope. Astronauts installed
                            new
                            instruments, including equipment adjusted to correct for the flaw in Hubble's primary
                            mirror.</b><br><br>

                        <li> <b> Servicing Mission 2 (SM2): Feb. 11-21, 1997 </b><br>
                            The installation of new instruments extended Hubble's wavelength range into the
                            near-infrared
                            for imaging and spectroscopy, allowing scientists to probe the most distant reaches of the
                            universe. The replacement of failed or degraded spacecraft components increased efficiency
                            and
                            performance.</b><br><br>

                        <li> <b> Servicing Mission 3A (SM3A): Dec. 19-27, 1999 </b><br>
                            What was originally conceived as a mission of preventive maintenance turned more urgent on
                            Nov.
                            13, 1999, when the fourth of Hubble's six gyros failed. Hubble requires at least three of
                            its
                            stabilizing gyros to conduct science. Hubble entered a state of dormancy called safe mode
                            while
                            the telescope waited for repairs. NASA split the third servicing mission into two parts to
                            more
                            quickly bring Hubble back into operation.</b><br><br>

                        <li> <b> Servicing Mission 3B (SM3B): March 1-12, 2002 </b><br>
                            During SM3B, astronauts replaced Hubble's solar panels and installed the Advanced Camera for
                            Surveys, which took the place of Hubble's Faint Object Camera, the telescope's last original
                            instrument.</b><br><br>

                        <li> <b> Servicing Mission 4 (SM4): May 11-24, 2009 </b><br>
                            The Hubble Space Telescope was reborn with Servicing Mission 4 (SM4). The fifth and final
                            servicing of the orbiting observatory flew aboard space shuttle Atlantis (STS-125) May
                            11–24,
                            2009.<br>

                            During SM4, two new scientific instruments were installed — the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph
                            (COS) and Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3). Two failed instruments, the Space Telescope Imaging
                            Spectrograph (STIS) and the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), were revived by the
                            first-ever
                            on-orbit repairs. With these efforts, Hubble was brought to the apex of its scientific
                            capabilities.<br>

                            To prolong Hubble's life, new batteries, new gyroscopes, a new science computer, a
                            refurbished
                            Fine Guidance Sensor and new insulation on three electronics bays were also installed during
                            the
                            mission's five spacewalks. Additionally, a device was attached to the base of the telescope
                            to
                            facilitate de-orbiting when the telescope is eventually decommissioned.<br>

                            The SM4 improvements should ensure the telescope's continued success and hopefully allow for
                            some overlap of scientific operations with Hubble's imminent successor, the James Webb Space
                            Telescope.<br>

                    <h2>Control Center</h2>
                    <p>NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center is home to the Hubble Space Telescope Operations Project, the
                        agency’s team of technical managers and scientists who oversee all aspects of the Hubble
                        mission. Under its direction, an integrated group of civil servants and contractors,
                        collectively known as the mission operations team, is responsible for Hubble’s day-to-day
                        activities — those functions of the mission that operate together to assure the health, safety,
                        and performance of the spacecraft. Examples of the work performed by the operations team include
                        commanding the spacecraft, monitoring and adjusting the spacecraft’s systems (power, thermal,
                        data management, pointing control, etc.), developing flight software, upgrading the control
                        center’s hardware and software, and maintaining the network and ground systems. Many of these
                        activities are performed in the Space Telescope Operations Control Center (STOCC), the nerve
                        center for Hubble’s mission operations.<br>


                        The STOCC consists of a Mission Operations Room (MOR) and an Operations Support Room (OSR). The
                        MOR is Hubble’s primary command and control room; both manual and automated operations are
                        performed from this location.<br>

                        Prior to the implementation of automated operations in May 2011, a team of console operators
                        staffed the MOR around the clock. They executed the required procedures to acquire
                        communications with the telescope, managed Hubble’s science and engineering data recorders, and
                        loaded Hubble’s computers with command sequences. They also monitored telemetry from the
                        spacecraft and reported any problems or concerns to the appropriate subsystem engineers.<br>

                        These functions, which form Hubble’s daily routine, are now performed autonomously, enabling
                        STOCC personnel to focus on special operations and various tests. Since the advent of automated
                        operations, the STOCC is staffed only eight hours a day, five days a week. If an anomaly occurs
                        on the spacecraft or within the ground system when the facility is unoccupied, a
                        high-reliability text messaging system immediately alerts the appropriate members of the
                        operations team.<br>

                        In the Operations Support Room (OSR), STOCC personnel work with a high-fidelity spacecraft
                        simulator, or directly with the spacecraft, to conduct a variety of tasks. These include testing
                        any configuration changes planned for Hubble, analyzing engineering telemetry, testing flight or
                        ground software updates, and running any contingency procedures or other special commanding in
                        response to an observatory anomaly. The operations team continuously examines spacecraft
                        subsystem performance, looking for trends that could signal component degradation and
                        identifying ways to improve system performance and extend the mission’s lifetime.<br>

                        Communications with Hubble are accomplished via a network interface from the STOCC to NASA’s
                        White Sands Test Facility complex located in White Sands, New Mexico, near Las Cruces. The large
                        antennas there transmit radio waves to NASA’s Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS),
                        which forwards them to Hubble. Science observations and engineering data that the telescope
                        stores on solid-state recorders are returned to Goddard using the reverse path. Once received
                        and quality checked, the science data is forwarded to the Space Telescope Science Institute via
                        dedicated high-speed network links where it is processed, archived, and distributed.<br>

                        The Hubble mission and science operations teams strive to set the standard for NASA’s great
                        observatories by continuously improving the telescope’s science productivity. The optical
                        quality of the telescope, the excellent pointing performance of the spacecraft, the diverse
                        capabilities of its instruments, and the skillful dedication of the mission’s staff keep Hubble
                        at the forefront of observational astrophysics. The observatory is operating at peak performance
                        thanks to the astronauts who successfully completed Servicing Mission 4 in May 2009. During that
                        mission, astronauts installed two advanced-technology instruments; repaired two others; replaced
                        a Fine Guidance Sensor, six gyros, six batteries and the instrument computer; and outfitted
                        certain equipment bays with protective thermal blankets. These upgrades position Hubble to
                        continue its mission of discovery into the next decade.</p>

                    <p>The Vehicle Electrical System Test (VEST) facility provides Hubble operations and engineering
                        personnel with a configurable, high-fidelity simulator of the Hubble observatory and its
                        operating environment.<br>

                        the spacecraft by simulating the conditions under which the anomaly was observed and to test
                        possible solutions. Second, it is used to verify updates to the software, commands and
                        engineering parameters before they are transmitted from the control center to the spacecraft.
                        This process includes a thorough test of the ground procedures used for uplinking and installing
                        these items. Finally, the VEST is used to verify operational procedures before they are executed
                        by the flight operations team.<br>

                        The VEST consists of several distinct elements. The largest is the integrated VEST structure
                        itself. This is a mechanical and electrical engineering model of Hubble’s middle section (known
                        as the Support Systems Module and the Optical Telescope Assembly Equipment Section) that
                        contains the majority of the spacecraft’s hardware subsystems. Mounted within the structure are
                        spaceflight-qualified modules developed as spares for servicing Hubble in orbit, and engineering
                        duplicates (where no spares exist) of such items as computers, data recorders, interface boxes,
                        power control units, etc.<br>

                        A second element includes specially fabricated units designed to mimic the functionality of
                        subsystems on Hubble that are too big or require emulation of the space environment. One such
                        area is the spacecraft’s electrical power subsystem, which includes its two solar arrays, drive
                        mechanisms (used to turn the arrays toward the Sun) and six large batteries. Another area is the
                        attitude guidance system that controls Hubble’s pointing and the observatory’s motion from
                        target to target. In this area are units that simulate Hubble’s four 100-pound (45-kg) reaction
                        wheels, six sensitive gyroscopes, sun sensors and other miscellaneous components.<br>

                        A third element simulates Hubble’s complex science instruments — both cameras and spectrographs.
                        In this case, large computer racks developed for each instrument known as instrument benches
                        simulate the electronics portion of an instrument and its optical parts like filter wheels,
                        calibration lamps and channel-select mechanisms. Additional imbedded components generate
                        realistic science data used to conduct end-to-end dataflow tests of the larger system.<br>

                        Prior to each of the five servicing missions to Hubble, the VEST structure was a critical
                        element for ensuring the fit of new spaceflight hardware into the spacecraft. Many of the items
                        taken aloft by the astronauts to Hubble were first installed into the VEST structure to verify
                        mechanical, electrical and software compatibility with the observatory. During that time, the
                        VEST structure was located inside a large clean room whose environment was vital to maintaining
                        the pristine condition of the hardware, as even a speck of dust could have potentially
                        contaminated Hubble’s sensitive instruments and subsystems.

                    <h2>Detailing the lives of young stars</h2>
                    <p>For centuries, astronomers have studied the stars, gathering information about their precise
                        positions and compositions to learn how they form. But it wasn’t until telescopes were launched
                        into space that we could begin to capture some of the most important information – which is
                        delivered by ultraviolet light.<br>

                        Ultraviolet emissions highlight part of the hottest material and the most energetic processes of
                        stars that recently formed or are still forming. Only the Hubble Space Telescope is currently
                        capable of making high-resolution ultraviolet light observations, which is why it has embarked
                        on an extensive three-year program, known as Hubble’s Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars
                        as Essential Standards (ULLYSES), to observe a set of high- and low-mass young stars.<br>

                        A spectrum reveals the elements that make up an object<br>

                        Hubble will build this dataset not with images, but by gathering spectra, which spread light
                        into its component wavelengths and reveal details about each star’s size, temperature, speed,
                        distance and composition. These data will help astronomers learn how stars form and what their
                        compositions are just after forming.
                            <br>
                        With these data, researchers will also be able to trace material as it follows magnetic fields
                        onto young stars, measure the strength and makeup of their stellar winds, and learn how the
                        stars impact their environments as or soon after they form.

                    <h2>Examining the Lives of Young Stars in Unprecedented Detail</h2>
                    <p>Hubble’s ULLYSES program will observe approximately 200 stars in 10 star-forming regions in our
                        Milky Way galaxy and in nearby low-metallicity dwarf galaxies. Its targets are a mix of high-
                        and low-mass young stars.<br>

                        The young high-mass stars are extremely active. These stars inject an amazing amount of energy
                        into their surrounding environments through ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds, which
                        impact local star formation. Their activity is matched by how long they take to form: Young
                        high-mass stars form rapidly over thousands of years. Hubble’s observations will help
                        researchers learn more about how their makeup, specifically their metallicities, control the
                        strengths of the winds they emit as well as how easily these stars can eject matter.<br>

                        In contrast, young low-mass stars can take a few million years to form. Hubble will observe
                        several of these young low-mass stars repeatedly, tracing how they gather material and emit UV
                        radiation, and change over short timescales. The observatory’s ultraviolet spectra will show
                        where the stars are most actively collecting this new material and how they are impacting their
                        immediate environments. For example: Why do these young low-mass stars launch opposing jets? How
                        do those jets inject energy into their environments?</p>

                    <h2>Stimulating Research for Decades to Come</h2>
                    <p>Hubble’s ULLYSES program was built by and for the research community, and its data will be
                        quickly released following each set of observations. The goal is for researchers around the
                        world to download and analyze them, publishing new breakthroughs about how young stars form.<br>

                        Astronomers may also go on to compare this ultraviolet data with complementary data – in radio
                        and infrared to visible and X-rays – from a range of observatories that are both on the ground
                        and in space. The program’s overarching goal is to provide a definitive data set on the first 10
                        million years of stellar evolution and help researchers understand the complexity of ultraviolet
                        spectra.<br>

                        The program, which will ultimately be a library that researchers continue to reference for
                        decades to come, will also support the exploration of a range of research topics. More fully
                        understanding the formation and lives of young stars has connections to many other areas in
                        astronomy, including galaxy formation and evolution, the mechanics and mass loss of supernovas,
                        how stars’ environments impact planet formation, and how their emissions may play a role in the
                        makeup of the interstellar medium. Hubble’s ULLYSES data applications are practically endless –
                        and will influence our understanding of the universe in ways we cannot yet predict.
