            <p style="font-weight:200;">
                In 1609, visionary Italian scientist Galileo Galilei turned the newly invented optical device of his day
                — the telescope — to view the heavens. His observations
                conclusively showed that there were celestial bodies
                (the moons of Jupiter) that did not revolve around the Earth, launching a revolution that forever
                changed our view of an Earth-centered universe.
                Hubble’s discoveries and memorable photos have also reinvigorated the public’s interest in astronomy.
                Along with pictures of the telescope and the astronauts who launched and serviced it during six space
                shuttle missions, certain memorable science images have become cultural icons.
                They appear regularly on book covers, musical albums, clothing, TV shows, movies and even ecclesiastical
                stained-glass windows.

                        Hubble Space Telescope aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery in 1990 started another revolution in
                        astronomy. Developed as a partnership between the United States space program and the European
                        Space Agency, Hubble orbits 332 miles (535 km) above Earth’s surface. Its gaze outward lies
                        beyond the distorting effects of the atmosphere, which blurs starlight and blocks some important
                        wavelengths of light from reaching the ground. This vantage point allows Hubble to observe
                        astronomical objects and phenomena more consistently and with better detail than generally
                        attainable from ground-based observatories. The telescope's sensitive cameras and spectrographs
                        can view objects as nearby and small as colliding asteroids to distant star-forming galaxies
                        that date back to when the universe was only three percent of its current age. In fact, Hubble
                        observations have played a key
                        role in discovering and characterizing the mysterious dark energy that now appears to permeate
                        space. Results like these have changed our fundamental understanding of the cosmos.

                    <h2>Discovering a Runaway Universe</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        Our cosmos is getting bigger. Nearly a century ago Edwin Hubble measured the expansion rate of
                        the universe. This value, called the Hubble constant,
                        is an essential ingredient needed to determine the age, size and fate of the cosmos. Before
                        Hubble was launched, the value of the Hubble constant was
                        imprecise, and calculations of the universe’s age ranged from 10 billion to 20 billion years.
                        Now, astronomers using Hubble have refined their estimates
                        of the universe’s present expansion rate and are working to make it more accurate. They do this
                        by getting better galaxy distance measurements from
                        Hubble and coupling these values with the best galaxy-velocity measurements obtained from other
                        telescopes. Scientists measure distances by comparing
                        the brightness of a known object in our galaxy (like a star or an exploded star) to that of a
                        similar object in a distant galaxy. With Hubble’s refined
                        distance values, calculations currently put the age of the universe as 13.8 billion years.

                    <p class="pb-4">
                        The universe was smaller in the past, galaxies were more likely to interact with one another
                        gravitationally. Some of Hubble’s cosmic “snapshots” show fantastic stellar streamers pulled out
                        and flung across space by colliding galaxies. They apparently settled over time into the more
                        familiarly shaped galaxies seen closer to Earth and hence nearer to the present time. By
                        carefully studying galaxies at different epochs, astronomers can see how galaxies changed and
                        evolved over time.
                        Among the things they investigate are the relative amounts of stars and gas in galaxies, the
                        types and amounts of identifiable chemical elements present, and star-formation rates
                        And the evolution continues. Hubble observations of our neighboring Andromeda galaxy (M31) have
                        allowed astronomers to predict with certainty that a titanic collision between our Milky Way
                        galaxy and Andromeda will inevitably take place beginning 4 billion years from now. The galaxy
                        is now 2.5 million light-years away, but it is inescapably moving toward the Milky Way under the
                        mutual pull of gravity between the two galaxies and the invisible dark matter that surrounds
                        them both.
                        The merger will likely result in the creation of a giant elliptical galaxy billions of years
                        from now.

                    <p class="pb-4">
                        Astronomers used Hubble to make the first measurements of the atmospheric composition of
                        extrasolar planets. Hubble observations have identified atmospheres that contain sodium, oxygen,
                        carbon, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor. Most of the planetary bodies studied
                        to date are too hot for life as we know it. But the Hubble observations demonstrate that the
                        basic organic components for life can be detected and measured on planets orbiting other stars.
                        In one case, astronomers had
                        sufficient data to make a detailed global map of an exoplanet showing the temperature at
                        different layers in its atmosphere, and the amount and distribution of its water vapor.
                        Hubble’s ultraviolet-light capabilities were used to uncover an immense cloud of hydrogen
                        bleeding off a planet orbiting a nearby star. The hydrogen is evaporating from a warm,
                        Neptune-sized planet due to extreme radiation from the star. This planet could explain the
                        existence of so-called hot super-Earths, which might have suffered a similar process and are now
                        stripped down to their exposed, rocky cores.

                    <p class="pb-4">
                        Hubble has witnessed impacts on Jupiter that were produced by minor bodies in the solar system.
                        The latest collision observed by Hubble occurred in 2009, when a suspected asteroid plunged into
                        Jupiter’s atmosphere and left a temporary dark feature the size of the Pacific Ocean. In 1994,
                        Hubble watched 21 fragments of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 bombard the giant planet sequentially —
                        the first time astronomers witnessed such an event.
                        Each impact left a temporary black, sooty scar within Jupiter’s clouds.
                        Jupiter is well known for its Great Red Spot, a giant storm roughly the size of Earth that has
                        been continuously visible since at least the late 1800s. The mammoth storm has been shrinking in
                        size for at least 90 years. Astronomers now use Hubble regularly to measure the Red Spot’s size
                        and investigate why it is slowly disappearing.
                        Jupiter’s moons also have yielded important clues in the search for life beyond Earth. Hubble
                        provided the best evidence yet for an underground saltwater ocean on Ganymede, the largest moon
                        in the solar system, by detecting related activity in Ganymede’s own auroras. This subterranean
                        ocean is thought to have more water than all the water on Earth’s surface. Hubble also recorded
                        evidence of transient changes in the atmosphere above the surface of Jupiter’s moon Europa.
                        Astronomers suspect that these disturbances are caused
                        by gas plumes expelled from a subsurface ocean. Identifying liquid water is crucial in the
                        search for habitable worlds beyond Earth and in the quest to find life as we know it.

                    <p class="pb-4">
                        Asteroids do not just slam into planets like Jupiter or Earth, they also collide with each
                        other. Astronomers using Hubble witnessed one such impact in the asteroid belt between Mars and
                        Jupiter, a reservoir of leftover rubble from the construction of our solar system. The Hubble
                        observations showed a bizarre, X-shaped pattern of filamentary structures near the point-like
                        core of an object with trailing streamers of dust. This complex structure suggested the small
                        body was the product of a head-on collision between two asteroids traveling five times faster
                        than a rifle bullet. Astronomers have long thought that the asteroid belt is being eroded
                        through collisions, but a crash had never been seen before.

                        Another Hubble observation of the asteroid belt revealed a unique object: an asteroid with six
                        comet-like tails of dust radiating from it like spokes on a wheel. Astronomers were surprised by
                        the asteroid’s unusual appearance. Unlike all other known asteroids, which appear simply as tiny
                        points of light, this asteroid resembles a rotating lawn sprinkler. Computer models of the
                        object suggest that the tails could have been formed by a series of dust-ejection events.

                    <h2>Hubble’s Mirror Flaw</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">When Hubble began returning science data to Earth, astronomers did not see crisp,
                        point-like images of stars. Instead, they saw stars surrounded by large, fuzzy halos of light.
                        They soon realized that this issue was created because the edges of the telescope’s primary
                        mirror were ground too flat by just a fraction of the width of a human hair. Although perfectly
                        smooth, the mirror could not focus light to a single point. It had been ground to the wrong
                        shape because of a flaw introduced into the test equipment used to evaluate the mirror’s
                        curvature prior to launch.

                        Although engineers designed Hubble with many replaceable components, the primary mirror was not
                        one of them. However, the ability for astronauts to upgrade the observatory in orbit ultimately
                        led to a solution for this seemingly unconquerable problem.

                        Before NASA even launched Hubble, engineers were hard at work building an improved,
                        second-generation camera for the space telescope. This instrument, called the Wide Field and
                        Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2), was meant for installation by astronauts at a future date. Optics
                        experts realized they could build corrective optics into this camera to counteract the flaw in
                        the primary mirror.

                        Meanwhile, Hubble scientists and engineers devised a set of nickel- and quarter-sized mirrors to
                        remedy the effects of the primary mirror on Hubble’s other instruments. Labeled the Corrective
                        Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR), this refrigerator-sized device could deploy
                        the corrective mirrors into the light paths of the telescope’s other science instruments to
                        focus their images properly.

                    <h2>Highlights of Hubble’s Exploration</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        Well into its third operational decade, Hubble is still extremely productive. The orbiting
                        telescope has taken over a million observations and provided data that astronomers
                        have used to write more than 19,000 peer-reviewed scientific publications on a broad range of
                        topics, from planet formation to gigantic black holes. These papers have been
                        referenced in other publications over 1.1 million times, and this total increases, on average,
                        by more than 150 per day. Every current astronomy textbook includes contributions
                        from the observatory.
                        Today’s college undergraduates have not known a time in their lives when astronomers were not
                        actively making discoveries with Hubble data.
