            <p style="font-weight:200;">
                The Hubble Space Telescope has made over 1.5 million observations since its launch in 1990, capturing
                stunning subjects such as the
                Eagle Nebula and producing data that has been featured in almost 18,000 scientific articles. But no
                image has revolutionized the way
                we understand the universe as much as the Hubble Deep Field.

                Taken over the course of 10 days in 1995, the Hubble Deep Field captured roughly 3,000 distant galaxies
                varying in their
                stages of
                evolution.
                Williams and his team needed a dark area with no nearby stars or other objects, whose glow would drown
                out the fainter
                galaxies he hoped to find with the exposure. That meant the area couldn’t be near the plane of the Milky
                Way, which was
                bright with cosmic objects. The area also needed to be a continuous viewing zone, or an area without
                interference from
                the Earth, Sun, or Moon. The team ultimately chose a location within Ursa Major, near the handle of the
                Big Dipper,
                that looked relatively empty. That emptiness would provide a gateway to see much farther back in time.

                In the end, the patch of sky was about the equivalent of holding a pinhead at arm’s length.

                    <h2>A Core Sample of the Universe</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        Most of the galaxies are so faint ― four billion times fainter than the human eye can see ― that
                        they had never been observed before, even by the largest telescopes.
                        “As the images have come up on our screens, we have not been able to keep from wondering if we
                        might somehow be seeing our own origins in all of this,” Williams said at the time. “These past
                        10 days have been an unbelievable experience.”

                        The “deep” in Hubble Deep Field refers to the telescope’s ability to look at some of these far,
                        faint objects. Looking at far-away objects in space is like seeing back in time. Light moves at
                        tremendous speed, but it still takes time to travel across the vastness of space. Even the light
                        from our own Sun needs eight minutes and 20 seconds to reach Earth, so when we look at the Sun,
                        we see it as it was a little more than eight minutes earlier. The farther away the object, the
                        younger it appears in Hubble’s gaze. The Deep
                        Field was like a core sample of space, showing galaxies at different and earlier stages of
                        development the deeper they appeared in the image.
                        Researchers from the State University of New York at Stony Brook analyzed the photo and chose
                        several dozen candidates that could be more distant than any galaxies seen up to that point.
                        They identified the galaxies based on their color, because more distant galaxies appear redder
                        as the light reaches us. This happens because the light stretches as it travels through the
                        universe, transforming into infrared wavelengths, which are redder.

                        A 1998 follow-up infrared image taken with Hubble’s Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object
                        Spectrometer discovered galaxies believed to be over 12 billion light-years away, even farther
                        than those seen in the Hubble Deep Field.

                    <h2>Hubble Deep Field South</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        After the success of the original Hubble Deep Field, astronomers sought new ways to increase our
                        understanding of the universe. Since it would take 900,000 years for astronomers to observe the
                        whole sky, they knew they would have to rely on more samples like the Hubble Deep Field to infer
                        what the entire universe looks like.

                        The Hubble Deep Field South focused on a region in the constellation Tucana, near the south
                        celestial pole, and doubled the number of distant galaxies available to astronomers. Williams
                        and a team of 50 astronomers and technicians at the Institute and at Goddard Space Flight Center
                        in Greenbelt, Maryland, carried out the 10-day-long observation in October 1998.

                    <h2>Hubble Ultra Deep Field</h2>
                    <p class="pb-4">
                        In 2004, Hubble captured a million-second-long exposure that contained 10,000 galaxies. This new
                        image, the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, observed the first galaxies to emerge from the “dark ages,”
                        a time just after the Big Bang.
                        “Hubble takes us to within a stone’s throw of the Big Bang itself,” said Massimo Stiavelli, an
                        instrument scientist for Hubble at the Space Telescope Science Institute.

                        From ground-based telescopes, the location of the Ultra Deep Field in the constellation Fornax ―
                        right below the constellation Orion ― looked mostly empty, much like the other Deep Field
                        locations, allowing for more distant observations to take place.

                        The Ultra Deep Field image contained several odd galaxies, such as one shaped like a toothpick
                        and another shaped like a bracelet link. Such galaxies come from a more chaotic time before the
                        development of structured galaxies like the Milky Way.

                        Ultra Deep Field data also taught astronomers that black holes at the center of galaxies likely
                        grew over time, that large galaxies build up gradually as others merge and collide, and that
                        some of the earliest galaxies were much smaller than our current Milky Way.

                        In 2009, Hubble captured near-infrared light wavelengths in the same region as the Ultra Deep
                        Field, revealing galaxies formed just 600 million years after the Big Bang.

                        The light from one object, called UDFj-39546284, traveled 13.2 billion light-years to reach
                        Earth. It’s a compact galaxy made up of blue stars, and astronomers found that the rate of star
                        formation grew by a
                        factor of 10 in just over 200 million years ― that may sound like a long time to us, but it’s
                        tiny for the universe.

                        In 2012, Hubble took it to the extreme. Astronomers combined 10 years of photographs taken of a
                        region in the center of the original Ultra Deep Field. Even with its smaller view, the eXtreme
                        Deep Field still showed 5,500 galaxies.

                        The faintest galaxies visible in this image are one ten-billionth of what the human eye can see,
                        and most of the galaxies shown are from when they were young and small, often colliding and
                        merging together.

                        After observations made over six weeks in August and September 2012, a team of astronomers
                        discovered a population of seven primitive galaxies formed when the universe was just 3% of its
                        present age.
                        The observations supported the idea that galaxies may have provided enough energy to reheat the
                        universe after the Big Bang.

                    <p class="pb-4">
                        The campaign provided 12 new deep field images, and astronomers were able to detect galaxies 100
                        times fainter than those they observed in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. Focusing on high-redshift
                        galaxies and gravitational lensing, or the natural distortion of light from massive galaxy
                        clusters,
                        the team worked to detect galaxies too faint to be seen by Hubble alone. Such an undertaking
                        propelled our understanding of the universe in ways that could only be achieved with all the
                        Great Observatories working together. The campaign ended in 2017, and now astronomers can use
                        the dataset to continue exploring the early universe.

                        Not only did the Hubble Deep Field change how we understand the universe, it also changed how we
                        share findings.

                        “This coming together of the community to generate a shared, nonproprietary dataset was
                        essentially unprecedented but has since become the model for the majority of large astronomical
                        projects,” wrote University of Washington astronomer Julianne Dalcanton. “This new mode of
                        operating has democratized astronomy.”
