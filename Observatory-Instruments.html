                Instruments on telescopes are used to make measurements of objects in space.
                Today telescopes have lots of different instruments on them. Each takes a different kind of measurement.
                They can be attached to the telescope in a number of places.
                The Hubble Space Telescope has three types of instruments that analyze light from the universe: cameras,
                spectrographs and interferometers.

            <p style="font-weight:200;">

                When astronomers first used telescopes, they looked through them and made drawings or notes of what they
                saw. When cameras were invented we could save this information as a picture.

                The images record what is seen. Modern cameras also let us see more detail. For example, by keeping the
                shutter on the camera open longer. This gives the image a longer exposure time letting more light reach
                the telescope. We use this to see fainter objects in space.
                The most common instruments are cameras. These are CCD cameras which can look at visible or infrared
                light. Spectrographs are also found on most telescopes. These split up the light into its different
                colours. They can also look at what an object is made of. They do this by looking for elements which
                absorb bits of the light.

                    <h2>Cameras</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hubble has two primary camera systems to capture images of the cosmos. Called the Advanced
                        Camera for Surveys (ACS) and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), these two systems work together to
                        provide superb wide-field imaging over a broad range of wavelengths.

                        Installed on Hubble in 2002, ACS was designed primarily for wide-field imagery in visible
                        wavelengths, although it can also detect ultraviolet and near-infrared light. ACS has three
                        cameras, called channels, that capture different types of images. An electronics failure in
                        January 2007 rendered the two most-used science channels inoperable. In 2009, astronauts were
                        able to repair one of the channels and restored ACS’s capacity to capture high-resolution,
                        wide-field views.

                        Installed in 2009, WFC3 provides wide-field imagery in ultraviolet, visible and infrared light.
                        WFC3 was designed to complement ACS and expand the imaging capabilities of Hubble in general.
                        While ACS is primarily used for visible-light imaging, WFC3 probes deeper into infrared and
                        ultraviolet wavelengths, providing a more complete view of the cosmos.

                    <h2>Spectrographs </h2>
                    <p>

                        Spectrographs practice spectroscopy, the science of breaking light down to its component parts,
                        similar to how a prism splits white light into a rainbow. Any object that absorbs or emits light
                        can be studied with a spectrograph to determine characteristics such as temperature, density,
                        chemical composition and velocity.

                        Hubble currently utilizes several spectrographs including the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS)
                        and the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). COS and STIS are complementary instruments
                        that provide scientists with detailed spectral data for a variety of celestial objects. While
                        STIS is a versatile, “all purpose” spectrograph that handles bright objects well, COS measures
                        exceedingly faint levels of ultraviolent light emanating from distant cosmic sources, such as
                        quasars in remote galaxies. Wide Field Camera 3 also has spectrographic capability and is often
                        used in the study of exo-planet atmospheres. The Advanced Camera for Surveys and the Near
                        Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Sprectrometer (which currently serves as a backup) have their
                        own set of spectrographic capabilities. Working together, these spectrographs provide a full set
                        of spectroscopic tools for astrophysical research.

                    <h2>Interferometers</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hubble’s interferometers serve a dual purpose — they help the telescope maintain a steady aim
                        and also serve as a scientific instrument. The three interferometers aboard Hubble are called
                        the Fine Guidance Sensors. The Fine Guidance Sensors measure the relative positions and
                        brightnesses of stars.

                        When Hubble is pointing at a target, two of the three Fine Guidance Sensors are used to lock the
                        telescope onto the target. For certain observations, the third Fine Guidance Sensor can be used
                        to gather scientific information about a target, such as a celestial object’s angular diameter
                        or star positions that are ten times more accurate than those obtained by ground-based
                        telescopes.

                        The Fine Guidance Sensors are very sensitive instruments. They seek out stable point sources of
                        light (known as “guide stars”) and then lock onto them to keep the telescope pointing steadily.
                        When a light in the sky is not a point source, the Fine Guidance Sensor cannot lock on and so it
                        rejects the guide star. Often, a rejected guide star is actually a faraway galaxy or a
                        double-star system. Since Hubble was launched in 1990, the Fine Guidance Sensors have detected
                        hundreds of double-star systems that were previously thought to be single stars.

                    <p>

                        Only one of the instruments remaining on Hubble — the third Fine Guidance Sensor — was launched
                        with the observatory in 1990. The rest of the instruments were installed during Hubble’s five
                        servicing missions. In addition to installing new instruments, astronauts also repaired two
                        instruments (ACS and STIS) while visiting Hubble on Servicing Mission 4 in 2009. The
                        Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) on Hubble is in hibernation
                        following a cryocooler anomaly, but most of its infrared duties have since been taken over by
                        WFC3.

                    <p class="my-4">
                        Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) – <br>ACS is a third-generation imaging camera. This camera is
                        optimized to perform surveys or broad imaging campaigns. <br><br>

                        Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) – <br>COS focuses exclusively on ultraviolet (UV) light and is
                        the most sensitive ultraviolet spectrograph ever, increasing Hubble's sensitivity at least 10
                        times in the UV spectrum and up to 70 times when looking at extremely faint objects. It is best
                        at observing points of light, like stars and quasars.<br><br>

                        Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) – <br>STIS is a second-generation
                        imager/spectrograph. STIS is used to obtain high-resolution spectra of resolved objects and has
                        the special ability to simultaneously obtain spectra from many different points along a
                        target.<br><br>

                        Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) – <br>Wide Field Camera 3 is the main imager on the telescope. It has
                        a camera that records visible and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths of light and is 35 times more
                        sensitive in the UV wavelengths than its predecessor, Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2. A
                        second camera that is built to view infrared (IR) light increases Hubble's IR resolution from
                        65,000 to 1 million pixels. Its combination of field-of-view, sensitivity and low detector noise
                        results in a 15-20 time improvement over Hubble’s previous IR camera.<br><br>

                        Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) – <br>The FGS provides pointing information for the spacecraft by
                        locking onto guide stars. The FGS can also function as a scientific instrument by precisely
                        measuring the relative positions of stars, detecting rapid changes in a star’s brightness, and
                        resolving double-star systems that appear as point sources even to Hubble’s cameras. Hubble has
                        three FGSs.<br><br>

                        Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) – <br>NICMOS has the ability to
                        obtain images and spectroscopic observations of astronomical targets at near-infrared
                        wavelengths. Although NICMOS is currently inactive, most of its functionality is replaced by
                        Hubble’s other science instruments.</p>
